Some things that need extra work:
- Parameter Handling for Generic types
- Index operator [] on List types
- Quickinfo and other intellisense lookup for GLOBALS and DEFINES in external Libs 
  (right now a single token is checked for Local, Field and Property, but it can also be a define or global)
- Quickinfo for #defines ?
- Formatting the source code
- Commenting the code does not work perfect yet.
- Implement Event Handler after += on Event property
- Looking up Description from XML comment files for assemblies (SVsXMLMemberIndexService, IVsXMLMemberIndex  )
- Delay lookups because the customer may still be typing
