  <StaticMemory>
    <remarks>
      <note type="tip">
        The Static Memory Functions (MemAlloc, MemSet etc) are included for compatibility only.
        In most cases the static memory blocks can (and should) be replaced with arrays of bytes.<br/>
        Many of the functions in the runtime that take memory blocks as parameter, such as the low level IO functions, now have overloads that take arrays of bytes as parameter.<br/>
        We recommend that you use these overloads, because their performance is somewhat better.

  <PSZ>
    <remarks>
      <note type="tip">
        The PSZ type is included in the X# language and runtime for compatibility only.
        In most cases the type can and should be replaced with normal strings. <br/>
        If you need to interface with Win32 API functions that expect an ansi string, there is often also
        an alternative with a unicode string. We recommend to use that alternative when possible.

        The SYMBOL type is included in the X# language and runtime for compatibility only.

  <Memvar>
    <remarks>
      <note type="tip">
        Dynamic memory variables (PUBLIC, PRIVATE, PARAMETERS) are supported in the X# language and runtime for compatibility only.<br/>
        In most cases the type can and should be replaced with lexically scoped variables, such as LOCALs and GLOBALs.

      <note type="tip">
        This function is included for compatibility. We do not recomment using static memory for file i/o operations.
        We recommend that you use the function overload that takes a byte array parameter in stead.

  <ZeroBasedIndex>
    <remarks>
      The indexer in this type is <em>ZERO</em> based, however in your PRG code you can use <em>ONE</em> based array indices.
      When the compiler detects an index operation to a class that implements this interface then the compiler will automatically
      adjust the indices (by subtracting one) unless the /az compiler option is enabled.
    </remarks>

  <ZeroBasedIndexParam>
    <span>
      This indexer is <em>ZERO</em> based, however in your PRG code you can use <em>ONE</em> based array indices.
      The compiler will recognize that this property is part of a type that implements a special interface
      and will subtract one from the indexes, unless the /az compiler option is enabled.
    </span>
  </ZeroBasedIndexParam>
  <NameBasedIndexParam>
    <span>
      Name of the property from the element stored in the location index. If the element implements IIndexedProperties,
      then the indexer with a string parameter on this element will be called. Otherwise the runtime will use reflection to find
      the field or property on the element and return its value
    </span>
  </NameBasedIndexParam>
  <ZeroBasedIndexProperty>
    <summary>
      Get/Set array elements with a <em>ZERO</em> based array index.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      In your PRG code you can assess the elements with a <em>ONE</em> based index.
      The compiler will recognize that this property is part of a type that implements a special interface
      and will subtract one from the indexes, unless the /az compiler option is enabled.
