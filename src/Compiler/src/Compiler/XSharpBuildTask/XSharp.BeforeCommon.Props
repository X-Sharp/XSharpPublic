<!-- 
   This file goes to the "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\MSBuild\Current\Imports\Microsoft.Common.props\ImportBefore" folder 
   MSBuild automatically includes all files there 
   It assumes there is an environment variable or property defined in the xsproj file with the name 
   "XSharpMsBuildDir" that points to the folder with the XSharp MsBuild support files
   By copying it there it will be automatically included in every build.
   The \Program Files (x86)\XSharp\Tools folder contains a program DeployMsBuildSupport.exe  that takes care of copying the file.
   This program can also be called with the /UNINSTALL command line option. That will remove all copies of this file, also the ones
   that are located inside MsBuild folders of various VS Installations and .Net.
