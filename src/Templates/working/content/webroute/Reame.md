# Sample Template for a RESTful Application using Attributes

The logic is handled in the **RESTful** Class.  

The `Run()` Method will create routes (GET/POST) using the `MapControllers()` method of the **WebApplication** class.

The **CustomersController** class is a sample on *How-To* create a route.  
Be aware that each access to the route will create a new **CustomersController** instance.


The **testRest** folder contains some sample queries.
