# XSharpPublic/VisualStudio
The Runtime Source in this folder is written in X# whenever possible.


#Code formatting
We have added an .EditorConfig in the root of this folder. This helps to ensure consistent code formatting .
Visual Studio 2017 will automatically use the settings from this file.
For Visual Studio 2015 you will need to load the EditorConfig extension to enable this.
For more info see https://editorconfig.org/
We intend to move the case synchronization setting to this file as well so you can easily ensure consistent case synchronization as well.
