## Roadmap

The first release of the project system ("15.0") was heavily focused on supporting .NET Core scenarios and parity with [VS 2015 project.json tooling](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3AParity-XProj%20).

16.x releases focused on [feature parity](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/labels/Parity-Legacy-Feature) with the legacy project system and support for .NET Core 3.0 and .NET 5.0.

17.x releases will focus on support for 64-bit Visual Studio, support for .NET 6.0, and revamping the project property and launch settings UI.
