        The ComboBoxTextValue assign also changes ComboBox:CurrentItem, ComboBox:CurrentItemNo, ComboBox:Modified, ComboBox:Value, and ComboBox:ValueChanged.  If the assign does not match one of the display items, then ComboBox:TextValue and ComboBox:Value are set to the text that could not be matched, and ComboBox:CurrentItemNo is set to 0.  If the control is bound to a field in a server and the field data value does not match one of the array's second elements, ComboBox:TextValue and ComboBox:Value contain the field's data value.

        If there is no selected item and the combo box is not bound to a field in a server, the ComboBox:Value is set to NIL.  If there is a match, the ComboBox:Value assign also changes ComboBox:CurrentItem, ComboBox:CurrentItemNo, ComboBox:TextValue, and ComboBox:ValueChanged.  If the assigned text does not match one of the return value choices, ComboBox:CurrentItemNo is set to 0, and TextValue and Value are set to the assigned text.  In a list box, the ComboBox:Value is generally one of the return values, unless the control is bound to a field where the actual contents is not one of the allowable choices; in this case, ComboBox:TextValue and ComboBox:Value contain the field's data value.
        The data type for ComboBox:Value is determined by the field specification of the list box; in turn, controls linked to a data server inherit the field specification — and hence data type — from the field of the server.  When the control is made data-aware, by setting its name to the name of a field in the server attached to the data window, ComboBox:Value is able to automatically read from and write to this field.
        <note type="tip">ComboBox:Value may not always be consistent with what the state of the control, as indicated to the end-user.  For example, if the data value for the field is not one of the allowed choices for a list box return value, the control will be in a "no-match" situation.  In this case the list box will revert to its initial unselected state with CurrentItemNo set to 0.</note>

      <summary>
        The notification code for this event as defined by the Windows API.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        The notification code for this event as defined by the Windows API.  The value of the notification code depends on the type of control and the event.  Refer to your Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit documentation for more details.
        <note type="tip">
          The ControlNotifyEvent:NotifyCode access returns a DWORD variable.
          NotifyCode Values in the Windows SDK are usually defines as:
          <code language="X#">
            DEFINE TVN_KEYDOWN             := (TVN_FIRST-12)
            DEFINE TVN_FIRST               := (0U-400U)
          </code>
          In prior versions of X# TVN_KEYDOWN compiled to a LONG with value -412. Most other development environments treat defines like these as DWORD (unsigned) because the TVN_FIRST has one or more unsigned constants in its definition.
          Unfortunately there is a small problem in X#:
          USUAL variables can only contain LONG or FLOAT numerics and not DWORDS.
          This means that if you call ControlNotifyEvent:NotifyCode late bound you will receive a USUAL and therefore a LONG.
          So in case the NotifyCode is TVN_KEYDOWN, then the USUAL will have a LONG value of -412.
          We therefore strongly advise to store Event objects in a type local. This ensures that you will get the correct numeric type:
          <code language="X#">
            METHOD ControlNotify(oControlNotifyEvent) CLASS HelpAbout
              LOCAL oControl AS Control
              LOCAL oCNEvent AS ControlNotifyEvent
              oCNEvent := oControlNotifyEvent
              oControl := IIF(oCNEvent == NULL_OBJECT, NULL_OBJECT, oCNEvent:Control)
              SUPER:ControlNotify(oControlEvent)
              IF oCNEvent:NotifyCode == TVN_KEYDOWN
                 // Do what you want to do
              ENDIF
              RETURN NIL

        A string representing the caption of the control (i.e., the static text identifying the control).  Examples include the label on the face of a button, the text written next to a check box or radio button, or the text on the border of a radio button group or group box.
        Note that not all controls have a visible caption.  For example, the ordinary edit control (MultiLineEdit class) does not have a visible caption — the text commonly displayed next to the edit is actually a separate control, placed there by the Window Editor.  Thus, assigning a new value to the caption of this type of control does not change anything on the screen.

        The name is important in steering the built-in processing of the system.  For example, the name of a push button is the name of the method that is invoked when the button is clicked, and the name of a control is the database field to which it is linked when a data window is linked to a data server.

        </para>
        <para>There are two assigns that aid owner alignment:</para>

          </item>
        </list>
        <para>
          Whenever one of these assigns is called, the current size and position of the control or window is saved to an internal array. The assign can be called as
          often as is required without any difficulty and it will simply over right the old values.

      <remarks>
        If the validation passed or the operation was successful, this value is NULL_OBJECT; if not, it contains information about the failure, which can be retrieved and displayed — for example:
        <code language="X#">
          IF !oControl:FieldSpec:Validate(x)
          &#0009;WarningBox{SELF, oControl:Status:Caption,;
          &#0009;&#0009;oControl:Status:Description}:Show()
          ENDIF
        </code>
        Hyperlabels are commonly used in the system, and in this case, the warning box is capable of accepting a hyperlabel and extracting the relevant information from it.  Thus, this example can be simplified even further:
        <code language="X#">
          IF !oControl:FieldSpec:Validate(x)
          &#0009;WarningBox{SELF,oControl:Status}:Show()

      <summary>
        A string representing the value held in the control.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        For example, in a standard edit control, the value can be "Jones" or "$14,683.00".  In a check box, the value can be "TRUE" or "FALSE".  For push buttons, Control:TextValue is set to NULL_STRING.  In a list box or combo box, Control:TextValue holds the display value text.  In a radio button group, Control:TextValue holds the caption text of the radio button that is currently selected.
        Note that the string is formatted according to the picture clause held in the field specification of the control; in turn, controls linked to a data server inherit the field specification - and hence picture clause - from the field of the server.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following examples demonstrate the use of the Control:TextValue property:
        <code language="X#">

          ?ValType(oDCAmountControl:TextValue)

      <summary>
        The value held in the control, in whatever data type the control holds.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        The value held in the control, in whatever data type the control holds.  Control:Value is thus of the usual data type.  For example, in a regular edit control, the value can be the string "Jones" or the number 14683.  In a check box, Control:Value can be TRUE or FALSE.  In a list box or combo box, the Control:Value is generally one of the return values (unless the control is bound to a field where the actual contents is not one of the allowable choices).  In a radio button group, Control:Value holds the group value (specified in the Window Editor) of the radio button that is currently selected;  if none is selected, Control:Value is set to NIL.
        The data type of the control's Value is determined by its field specification; in turn, controls linked to a data server inherit the field specification — and hence data type — from the field of the server.  When the control is made data-aware, by setting its name to the name of a field in the server attached to the data window, Control:Value is able to automatically read from and write to this field.
        <note type="tip">Value may not always be consistent with the state of the control, as indicated to the end-user.  For example, if the data value for the field is not one of the allowed choices for a list box or combo box return value, or among the group value settings for the radio buttons in a radio button group, the control will be in a "no-match" situation.  In this case the control will revert to its initial unselected state.</note>
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following examples demonstrate the use of the Control:Value property:
        <code language="X#">
          // Prints "N" for numeric
          ?ValType(oDCAmountControl:Value)
          // Access the control (numeric value)
          nAmount := oDCAmountControl:Value
          // Assign 5 to the control
          oDCAmountControl:Value := 5

      <remarks>
        A logical value representing whether the control's Value has been changed from its prior setting.  TRUE indicates that it has been changed from its prior setting, while FALSE indicates it has not.  The Control:ValueChanged access is especially useful when the control is bound to a field in a server, since it is reset to FALSE each time you move to a new record.  It is set to TRUE if you have changed from the original data value.

            <description>All the records in the entire set provided by the server are locked throughout.  This is not very practical for windows associated with all the records of a server, since it would correspond to a file lock.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with method DataWindow:SetSelectiveRelation(). </description>

      <summary>
        The context menu attached to the window
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        This can be used in two ways.
        The DataWindow and its Browser usually share the same ContextMenu and in this situation the assign can be used like this –
        <code language="X#">&lt;oDataWindow&gt;:ContextMenu := MyContextMenu{}</code>
        If you want the context menus to be different you can now use code like this –
        <code language="X#">&lt;oDataWindow&gt;:[ContextMenu,#FormView] := MyContextMenu{}</code>
        to just set the FormView context menu, and this –
        <code language="X#">&lt;oDataWindow&gt;:[ContextMenu,#BrowseView] := MyOtherContextMenu{}</code>
        to set the BrowseView context menu.

      <remarks>
        A logical value specifying whether the Use() operation for connecting the data window to the associated server should be deferred until the data window is first displayed.  This is useful, for example, in a situation where multiple data windows build up pages for a tab control.  The default is FALSE.

        The "FOR block" component of the "general server scope," which affects several bulk processing methods if they are called with no explicit scope.  The FOR block can be specified as a code block or a string.  This access always returns a code block.
        Specifying a FOR block makes the method process all those records where the FOR block evaluates TRUE, subject to other scope settings, of course.  Specifying a FOR block makes the Scope default to ALL in those cases where it is otherwise "current record," unless a WhileBlock is also specified in which case it is set to REST.

      </summary>
      <remarks>
        A numeric value representing the current record number, identifying the position of the record pointer.
        Assigning a value to RecNo is equivalent to executing GoTo(); both reposition the record pointer on the given record.
        These two statements are equivalent:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBServer:RecNo := 1168
          oDBServer:GoTo(1168)
        </code>
        If the server contains a database file with 0 records, RecNo returns 1, BOF and EOF both return TRUE, and RecCount/LastRec return 0.  If the record pointer is moved past the last record, RecNo returns LastRec + 1 and EOF returns TRUE.  If an attempt is made to move before the first record, RecNo returns the record number of the first logical record in the database file and BOF returns TRUE.
        The DBServer:RecNo assign sends a NotifyIntentToMove message before the operation.
      </remarks>

        This example queries RecNo after deliberately moving the record pointer:

        Note that the string is formatted according to the picture clause held in the field specification of the edit field; in turn, edit fields linked to a data server inherit the field specification — and hence picture — from the field of the server.

        When accessing FileSpec:Path, the requested path is returned with a leading slash and when applicable a trailing slash.
        When assigning FileSpec:Path, you can specify a path with or without leading or trailing slashes.  To specify the root, assign a single slash.  Assigning a NULL_STRING (or NIL) to the drive means that the drive is unknown or unspecified; the various functions and objects that use the file specification to locate the file looks on whatever default drive would apply if a file name without a drive is specified.
        Assigning a value to the path normally does not affect the drive, file name, or extension.  If a drive is included in the path, it is assigned to the path.

      <summary>
        A value (second element in the FillUsing() array) representing the currently selected item, formatted according to the picture clause of the field specification attached to the list box (or combo box).  For example the TextValue can be "Jones", "01/15/95", or "8".  If there is no selected item and the list box is not bound to a field in a server, the ListBox:Value is set to NIL.  The ListBox:Value assign also changes ListBox:CurrentItem, ListBox:CurrentItemNo, ListBox:TextValue, and ListBox:ValueChanged.
        If the assigned text does not match one of the return value choices, ListBox:CurrentItemNo is set to 0, and ListBox:TextValue and ListBox:Value are set to the assigned text.  In a list box, the ListBox:Value is generally one of the return values, unless the control is bound to a field where the actual contents is not one of the allowable choices, and there is a no-match situation; in this case ListBox:TextValue and ListBox:Value contain the field's data value.
        The data type for ListBox:Value is determined by the field specification of the list box; in turn, controls linked to a data server inherit the field specification — and hence data type — from the field of the server.  When the control is made data-aware, by setting its name to the name of a field in the server attached to the data window, ListBox:Value is able to automatically read from and write to this field.
        <note type="tip">ListBox:Value may not always be consistent with what the state of the control, as indicated to the end user.  For example, if the data value for the field is not one of the allowed choices for a list box return value, the control will be in a "no-match" situation.  In this case the list box will revert to its initial unselected state with ListBox:CurrentItemNo set to 0.</note>

        The MouseEvent:ButtonID access method does not work in Window:MouseDrag() event handlers if the user presses more than one mouse button simultaneously.  To handle with multiple buttons, invoke the methods of MouseEvent (like IsLeftButton() and IsRightButton()), which report on individual buttons.

        An array containing descriptions of the methods, properties, and variables of the OLE automation server represented by the OLEAutoObject.  This array is only intended for use by the OLEAutoObject class — the user must not manipulate it.
        This array exists only for instances of the OLEAutoObject class.  Generated automation server classes that inherit from OLEAutoObject do not need this array since the method information is generated and expanded into code.
        The array is used as a kind of Hash table. The position in the array is calculated from the name of the methods or properties. The elements in the array are objects of the class cOleMethod. This class is used to describe the methods from a OleAutoObject.

    <member name="P:VO.OLEAutoObject.DateTimeAsDate">
      <summary>
        An OLE date is actually a DateTime combination, often known as a timestamp in SQL databases. This combination of DateTime can not be stored in a DBF Date field and is not recognised by the Date FieldSpec as being a valid date.
        When an OLE date field is returned it is an instance of the OleDateTime class and the values can be extracted from this.
        However, by setting the DateTimeAsDate to TRUE, all OLE dates will be returned as VO dates in the standard format.

      <summary>
        The instantiation of an OLEAutoObject object does not mean that the OLE automation has been successfully started.  For example, moving an automation application from one PC to another will cause the application to malfunction if the OLE automation server is not installed on the new PC.  In this case trying to use the OLEAutoObject after instantiation would cause runtime error.
        After creating the object, OLEAutoObject:fInit lets you check to see if the OLE automation server has been successfully initialized.  It returns TRUE if the OLE automation server has been initialized properly; otherwise, it returns FALSE.
      </summary>
      <example>
        This example displays an error message if the automation server could not be successfully initialized after instantiation:

          o := OLEAutoObject{"Word.Basic"}

        The data type of the control's Value is determined by its field specification; in turn, controls linked to a data server inherit the field specification — and hence data type — from the field of the server.  When the control is made data-aware, by setting its name to the name of a field in the server attached to the data window, Value is able to automatically read from and write to this field.
        <note type="tip">RadioButtonGroup:Value may not always be consistent with what the state of the control, as indicated to the end-user.  For example, if the data value for the field is not among the group value settings for the radio buttons in a radio button group, the control will be in a "no-match" situation.  In this case the control will revert to its initial unselected state.</note>

        A numeric value representing the relative position in the data server.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        A numeric value representing the relative position in the data server.
        It is not possible to efficiently or accurately determine how many records are in the result set for SQL (especially for databases that support scrollable cursors, like WATCOM).  Therefore, negative numbers are used to reflect relative position from the bottom of the database, as positive numbers are used to reflect relative position from the top of the database.
        If the server is positioned at the Phantom record (after skipping past the last record) SQLSelect:Recno returns SQLSelect:Reccount+1
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following example demonstrates the value that SQLSelect:RecNo returns after each method is called:
        <code language="X#">
          oCust := SQLSelect{"SELECT * FROM customer"}
          oCust:GoTop()
          ? oCust:RECNO&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// Prints 1
          oCust:Skip()
          ? oCust:RECNO&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// Prints 2
          oCust:GoBottom()

        <code language="X#">oToolBar:[Rows, #MYTOOLBAR] := 4</code>
        where #MYTOOLBAR is the symbol name representing the toolbar you which to change.
        There are two ways to query the number of rows in the main toolbar:
        <code language="X#">
          nRows := oToolBar:Rows
          nRows := oToolBar:[Rows, #MAINTOOLBAR]
        </code>
        To query the number of rows in the sub-toolbar represented by #MYSUBTOOLBAR, you could do the following:
        <code language="X#">nRows := oToolBar:[Rows, #MYSUBTOOLBAR]</code>
      </example>

    <member name="T:VO.Accelerator">
      <summary>
        Create an accelerator table.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        Many applications use accelerators as keyboard equivalents for menu selections.  An accelerator is a keystroke sequence that is associated with a particular menu command — the accelerator is used to execute the menu command without requiring the application user to first display the menu and then choose the command.
        For example, if the File New command had an accelerator of Ctrl+N, you could simply press this key combination to open a new document, rather than having to choose the File menu and then the New command.
        Each window can be given its own accelerator using the Window:Accelerator property.  An accelerator generates events as though its associated menu command was actually selected.  Note that an accelerator's menu command does not even have to be visible on any menu — thus an accelerator can be seen as a direct keystroke sequence for generating a command event.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following example demonstrates the use of the Accelerator class:
        <code language="X#">
          METHOD Init() CLASS MyTopAppWindow
          &#0009;SUPER:Init()
          &#0009;SELF:Show()
          &#0009;SELF:Accelerator := Accelerator{IDA_HOTKEYS}
        </code>
        <br/>
        In Windows, an accelerator object is created using the ACCELERATORS statement in the resource entity.  For example, the following defines three accelerator keys:  "^X" for the Exit menu command, "Ctrl+Insert" for the Copy menu command, and "Shift+Insert" for the Paste menu command.
        <code language="X#">
          RESOURCE IDA_HOTKEYS ACCELERATORS
          BEGIN
          &#0009;^X, IDMI_EXIT
          &#0009;VK_INSERT, IDMI_COPY, VIRTKEY, CONTROL
          &#0009;VK_INSERT, IDMI_PASTE, VIRTKEY, SHIFT
          END

    <member name="T:VO.App">
      <summary>
        Create an entity that represents the overall application. Please note that you have to create a subclass of App in your code and add a Start() method to this class. You can't add a Start() method to the App() class inside GUI Classes like you can in VO.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        The App class starts, runs, and stops the application. However, nearly all the code in an application executes in event handlers.<br/>
        Once you invoke the method App:Exec(), the system starts sending you events.<br/>
        While the term application is consistent in both the windowing and non-windowing worlds, the event-driven nature of a windowing application is designed to handle user-driven events (such as a mouse click or the resizing of a window).  As a result, the function of the windowing application is relegated to an event scheduling loop.<br/>
        In this class, the Start() method is analogous to the entry point START() function in CA-Clipper.  It is where the main elements of your application are constructed.  The objects declared within App:Start() should be those which have "application wide" scope.<br/>
        Within the App:Start() method you must call App:Exec().  Doing so invokes the message processing loop of your underlying windowing system and begins the system event handling mechanism by activating the system dispatcher.<br/>
        The App:Exec() method can be thought of as a layered service with a typical "get-translate-dispatch-message" mechanism driven by your underlying windowing system and a "filter-translate-dispatch-event" mechanism being directed through the system framework by the system dispatcher.<br/>
        The App:Quit() method provides a way of breaking out of the application's Exec() loop to terminate the application.  It is analogous to the QUIT() function in CA-Clipper.<br/>
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following example demonstrates an entire application, using the various methods of the App class:

        You can also use the ControlWindow class to create buttons with behaviors and/or appearances that differ from standard buttons.  Using ControlWindow permits controls to trap events.  Typical uses might include customizing the appearance of controls (like changing the background and foreground colors) or modifying the key handling.

    <member name="T:VO.CheckBox">
      <summary>
        Create check boxes, which are controls that can be toggled on or off by a user (or for 3-state check boxes, to a third state).
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        A check box allows the user to choose between 2 or 3 states.  A 2-state check box allows a choice between a checked (ON) and unchecked (OFF) state.  The choice is reflected in CheckBox:Value access, which may be TRUE or FALSE.  A 3-state check box adds a third (UNDETERMINED) state, in which the box is dimmed.  The third state is indicated by CheckBox:Value being TRUE and by CheckBox:ValueChanged (which is normally TRUE) being FALSE.
        A check box may be bound to a logical field in a server.  Because of this, you can not directly bind a 3-state check box to a server; instead you must create a numeric or character field to store the 3-state information,  and update it based on the status of the CheckBox:Value and CheckBox:ValueChanged accesses.
        <br/>
        The Window:ButtonClick() event handler responds to events in the check box.  The default behavior of the event handler is to toggle the state of the check box.  Typically, you would implement your own ButtonClick() event handler in which you first call the default handler to set the state of the buttons.  For example:
        <code language="X#">
          METHOD ButtonClick(oControlEvent) CLASS MyWind
          &#0009;SUPER:ButtonClick(oControlEvent)
          &#0009;// Do something else
        </code>
      </remarks>
      <example>
        This example creates a check box on a dialog window and then checks it:
        <code language="X#">
          CLASS MyDialog INHERIT DialogWindow
          &#0009;HIDDEN oCBNew AS OBJECT
          METHOD Init(oWindow,nResourceID) CLASS MyDialog
          &#0009;SUPER:Init(oWindow,nResourceID)
          &#0009;oCBNew := CheckBox{SELF,IDB_CHECKBOX}
          &#0009;oCBNew:Checked := TRUE
          &#0009;SELF:Show()
        </code>
        <br/>
        In Windows, check boxes are equivalent to a button with the BS_CHECKBOX style.  The style BS_AUTOCHECKBOX is useful because the button is automatically checked and unchecked without any code being written in the system.  They are normally specified in the resource entity like this:
        <code language="X#">
          RESOURCE IDD_ABOUT DIALOG 20,20,160,120
          STYLE WS_POPUP | WS_DLGFRAME
          BEGIN
          &#0009;CHECKBOX "&amp;Color"  IDB_COLOR,10,20,40,12
          &#0009;CHECKBOX "&amp;Filled" IDB_FILLED,10,35,40,12
          &#0009;CONTROL "&amp;Auto",IDB_AUTO,"button", BS_AUTOCHECKBOX,10,65,40,12
          &#0009;DEFPUSHBUTTON "OK"  IDB_OK,64,80,32,14, WS_GROUP
          END

    <member name="T:VO.ChildAppWindow">
      <summary>
        Create child application windows.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        A child application window is an application window that "belongs to" another window (its owner).  Because a child application window is not independent of the owner window, it is always destroyed, hidden, or iconized when its owner window is destroyed, hidden, or iconized.  Also note that child application windows are clipped against the owner window.
        Child application windows do not have a default size and position on their owner window.  They must be given an origin and size before they are shown.
        <br/>
        In Windows, a child application window never displays a menu (except for the system menu).  However, it can own a menu.  If the child window is used as an MDI child under a shell window, its menu is displayed in the shell.
        This is very useful: when different child windows present different types of data, they often need different menus.  The system automatically switches the owner shell window's menu according to which child window has focus.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following example displays a child window:
        <code language="X#">
          CLASS MyTopAppWindow INHERIT TopAppWindow
          &#0009;HIDDEN oCAWNew AS OBJECT
          METHOD Init() CLASS MyTopAppWindow
          &#0009;SUPER:Init()
          &#0009;oCAWNew := ChildAppWindow{SELF,FALSE}

    <member name="T:VO.ComboBox">
      <summary>
        Create a combo box, which is used when you need to provide the user with both a list of choices and an edit control (to optionally allow them to type in their own choice).
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        A combo box (also known as a combination box) is a control that combines the abilities of an edit control and a list box.  There are three types of combo boxes — simple, drop-down, and drop-down list.
        A combo box displays a list of items or choices to the user, as well as allowing text to be entered directly into an edit area.  The combo box methods will allow you to add, arrange, remove, and interrogate the list of  items.
        When one of the items is selected, ComboBox:CurrentItem, ComboBox:CurrentItemNo, ComboBox:TextValue, and ComboBox:Value are updated.  Either a one-dimensional or two-dimensional array is specified in the FillUsing() method, with a row for each of the items available for selection.  With a two-dimensional array, the first element is called the display value, and the second element is called the return value.  When an item is selected, the ComboBox:TextValue contains the first element (the display value), and ComboBox:Value contains the second element (the return value).  When text is directly entered, ComboBox:CurrentItemNo is set to 0 and the new text is stored in ComboBox:TextValue and ComboBox:Value.
        A combo box may be bound to a field (character, date, logical, numeric, or memo) in a server.  The field's data value is stored in ComboBox:Value.  The combo box compares the data value to the second element values specified in the FillUsing() array, and if a match is found, the first element (the display value) is stored in ComboBox:TextValue.  In a "no-match" situation, the combo box shows no item selected, ComboBox:CurrentItem is NULL_STRING, ComboBox:CurrentItemNo is set to 0, and ComboBox:TextValue and ComboBox:Value reflect the field contents.  If an item is selected, ComboBox:CurrentItemNo is set to a number between 1 and ComboBox:ItemCount, and the corresponding second element is stored as ComboBox:Value and as the field's data value.  If text is directly entered, it will also be stored as the field's data value.
        <br/>
        Use the Window:ListBoxSelect() event handler to respond to selections, and the Window:ListBoxClick() event handler to respond to choices.
        A combo box is primarily a selection device, so there is no special support for the functionality available in the Edit class.  However, the contents of the edit component can be changed or obtained using the inherited CurrentText access/assign methods.
        The combo box also generates EditFocusChangeEvents when its edit control loses or receives the focus.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        This example creates a combo box and fills it with a list of animals:
        <code language="X#">
          CLASS MyWindow INHERIT TopAppWindow
          &#0009;HIDDEN oCB AS OBJECT
          METHOD Init() CLASS MyWindow
          &#0009;SUPER:Init()
          &#0009;oCB := ComboBox{SELF,42,Point{10,10},;
          &#0009;&#0009;&#0009;Dimension{100,40},BOXDROPDOWN}
          &#0009;oCB:AddItem("Pig")
          &#0009;oCB:AddItem("Cow")
          &#0009;oCB:AddItem("Horse")
          &#0009;oCB:Show()
        </code>
        This example creates a combo box with different currencies, showing an explicit representation to the user but using a different representation internally:
        <code language="X#">
          METHOD Init(...) CLASS OrderWindow

      <remarks>
        A ComboBoxEx control is a ComboBox control with two extensions.
        Firstly, each item in the list is able to display an image beside it. This is achieved with the use of an ImageList object that is assigned to the control. It is also able to overlay a second image when the item is selected. Both images are specified when the item is added to the control.
        Secondly, unlike the normal ComboBox control, a ComboBoxEx control is not restricted inside of the frame of its owner but, can pass over the frame and into the surrounding area so as to display its list of entries in the drop-down box.

        A noticeable difference between the implementation of the two libraries can be seen when starting an application from the command line.  A Terminal Lite application will get a new window allocated, while a Console Classes application runs in the same window in which it was started.  Depending on the command line setting, a Console Classes application can also run full screen, while a Terminal Lite application cannot.  Also, using the Console Classes does not require an additional runtime DLL to be distributed with your application.
        <note type="tip">The application type has to be set to Console in the Application Options dialog box in order to run the application within the Win32 console.  Otherwise, a separate console window is created.  You can also use the Console class to create a separate console window in a regular Windows application, e.g., to output some debug information.</note>

        Provide the base class from which all X# controls are subclassed.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        Control is the base class for a major system class hierarchy.  Controls provide an easy mechanism for user I/O.  They are self-contained and notify their respective owners when the user takes some action (such as pressing a button or entering text).
        Controls on dialog windows created from resource entity templates are shown automatically when the dialog window is shown.  However, if the application wishes to manipulate a control, it must register the control by creating a system object of the appropriate type.
        Controls must appear in an owner window.  They also need to know where to appear.  There are two basic ways you can specify where; one is by placing the control using the Window Editor.  In this case, X# generates a resource to represent the control.  When you construct the control in your program, you pass to the constructor the ID of the resource as its second argument.  The other way is to place the controls dynamically, in which case, you pass the position and size of the control as the third and fourth arguments (the first argument is always the owner and the second argument is always the resource ID).  Even when you place the control dynamically, you pass in a unique ID as the second argument.

        Many controls generate notification events, which are sent to their parent window so that the parent window can take some action.  The notification is sent to the parent in the form of the ControlNotify event handler.  This event is often subclassed so that a control can send an event object that is specific to the control and the notification.  In this case, a more specific event handler in the parent is called as well.

        When a control is created as part of the Window hierarchy, it can trap events.  For example, you might want to customize the appearance of controls (like changing the background and foreground colors) or modify their default key handling.
        Manipulating a control via the ControlWindow class requires more overhead than those created by the subclasses of Control.  Therefore, it is recommended that control windows be used only where special handling is needed (for example, to override the handling of certain events or call some window method on a control).

      <summary>
        Create a data browser, which is a spreadsheet-like table for displaying information from a data server.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        A data browser is a control, like a check box or edit field.  However, it should ordinarily not be created as an independent control; the easiest way to use a data browser is to switch a data window to browse view.  This creates the DataBrowser object; it may be referenced through the data window's Browser property.
        The data browser is data-aware, like a window, and may be connected to a data server as a client.  It exhibits much of the same behavior as a data window:  it propagates data down to the server and it responds to all the notification messages that a server sends to its clients.
        The easiest way to place a browser on a window as a control together with other controls is to place another data window as a nested subform; see the DataWindow class for a description.  This is easily done in the Window Editor using the Edit Insert menu commands or the Auto Layout feature.  See "Using the Window Editor" in your IDE User Guide for details.
        <note type="tip">Static dependencies to the CATO3*.DLL files, which contain the DataBrowser and SplitWindow functionality, have been removed in this version of X#.  Applications not using a data browser and/or split window no longer need these .DLLs.  This leads to a smaller memory footprint, faster application startup, and smaller installations.</note>
        <br/>
        Data browsers present information in a spreadsheet-like table, with rows and columns.
        The columns are DataColumn objects.  Data columns correspond to fields in a data server — each data column is linked to a server field (just like data controls on a data window).
        The rows correspond to records in the server.  Unlike a regular data window, which displays only one record — the "current" record — at a time, the browser displays several records as rows in the table.  It always maintains one row as the "current" row, which is the record the server is positioned on.  References to the data and action methods that manipulate the data always refer to the "current" record, just like in a regular data window.  The only difference, therefore, is visual, in that the browser shows records other than the current one.
        <br/>
        The user and the developer have a great deal of flexibility in the visual layout of data browsers.  Columns can be resized and rearranged on the fly, by the user with the mouse (unless the developer disables these options) or under program control.
        To retain meaningful control of a column's contents after it has been rearranged, columns are identified by their name.  If there is a need to use numbers for reference (as in a generic utility program that knows nothing of the meaning of its data), the columns can be referenced by their original positional number in the browser, which may or may not be the same as their visual position.

        Whereas a regular data window is an MDI child window, a data dialog window behaves like a modal dialog window.  This means that the user must respond to the window and close it before continuing with the application and that the data dialog window is not resizable.
        The main purpose of this class is to provide a way to create a window for small data entry tasks, such as password entry.
        Note that because the DataDialog class uses DialogWindow (rather than a ChildAppWindow) internally, AppWindow:EnableVerticalScroll() and AppWindow:EnableHorizontalScroll() are just stubs — they do not do anything.

      <summary>
        Create a field, which is an object that holds information that defines a particular field in a data server (for example, the field's data type and length).
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        A DataField object is a specific item in a database record.  This is in contrast to a FieldSpec object, which is a description of the properties that some field might have.
        For example, assume you want to create a FieldSpec object that defines an employee number and you have an EMPLOYEE database that has two different fields: EMPNO, which the employee's number (the employee whose record this is), and MGRNO, which is the number of that employee's manager.  Thus, you might define the FieldSpec object as follows:
        <code language="X#">
          CLASS EmployeeNumber INHERIT FieldSpec
          ...
        </code>
        and then in the database define two different fields as:
        <code language="X#">
          DataField{HyperLabel{#EmpNo, "Employee Number"}, ;
          &#0009;EmployeeNumber{}}
          DataField{HyperLabel{#MgrNo, "Manager Number"}, ;
          &#0009;EmployeeNumber{}}
        </code>
        Note that some of the field properties can appear redundant given the available FieldSpec properties.  For example, the field contains a hyperlabel, but the field's FieldSpec object also contains a hyperlabel.  Furthermore, the field's hyperlabel contains a symbolic name, and the FieldSpec's hyperlabel contains a symbolic name.
        However, this apparent redundancy serves a useful purpose.  A FieldSpec's hyperlabel identifies the general class of data (called #EmpNo in this example).  This name is often used as the standard name of fields of this type, but it does not have to be, because each particular field has a specific name — in the example above, #EmpNo and #MgrNo.
        A field, therefore, holds two "groups" of properties:
        &#0009;General label information, like its name, caption, description, and help context ID
        &#0009;Data type information, stored as a FieldSpec object, that includes data type, length, decimals, validation rules, error messages, diagnostics, and formatting rules
        In any case, all data-oriented objects in the system have a name and a hyperlabel, which are often shipped around the system for annotation and help purposes.
        Important!  There is rarely a need for the developer to consider the fields directly as they are typically created through the code generated by the various data server editors.

        <note type="tip">Please see Description below for its limitations.</note>
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        A data list view is a "data-ware" list view control which serves as a fast, read-only alternative to a data browser.  Together with the list view column control, a data list view can be used inside the Window Editor to "paint" the browse view portion of a data window.  It can also be used as a standalone control.
        The DataListView control uses internally a virtual list view, which means that its speed is independent of the total number of records in your database.  Additionally, the scrollbar size and position always represents the position in the database correctly.
        The DataListView control relies on the OrderKeyCount(), OrderKeyGoto(), and OrderKeyNo() methods of the associated server.  If there is no active order, the DataListView control uses RecCount(), GoTo(), and RecNo() instead.  Additionally, the DataListView control has some limitations, depending on the currently active RDD:
        &#0009;SetFilter is supported for NTX and CDX drivers only.
        &#0009;SetDeleted(TRUE) is not supported for all RDDs.
        &#0009;If you want to hide all deleted records, you should use SetDeleted(FALSE) and specify a data server filter condition like:
        <code language="X#">&#0009;SetFilter({|| !Deleted()}, "!Deleted()")</code>
        &#0009;OrderScopes are supported for NTX and CDX drivers only.
        If you want to use a DataListView control as a replacement for a DataBrowser control, set the Browser Inherits From property in the Window Editor to DataListView.  The generated code will then reference DataListView.
        <note type="tip">Choosing a DataListView control as a replacement for a DataBrowser control has an additional advantage:  your applications will not need the CATO3xxx.DLL support DLLs.</note>
        The DataListView control can also be used as a standalone control that can be placed on any window or dialog.  In this case, you have to explicitly assign a data server to the DataListView:Server property.

      <summary>
        Create a data window which is capable of interacting intelligently with a data server.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        Data windows combine the properties and behavior of both child windows and dialog windows, and add data-aware behavior that enables them to interact intelligently with data servers.  When connected to a data server, a data window forms a view of the server that allows for direct access and manipulation of the server's data.
        <br/>
        Unlike the other types of windows, a data window takes on different behavior depending on how it is used.  It adapts itself to the demands placed on it by its owner, behaving differently depending on the circumstances:
        If Owner Is&#0009;Data Window Acts Like
        ChildAppWindow&#0009;Modal DialogWindow
        DataWindow&#0009;Modal DialogWindow (if no placement is specified) or nested sub-data window (if placement is specified)
        DialogWindow&#0009;Modal DialogWindow
        ShellWindow&#0009;ChildAppWindow
        TopAppWindow&#0009;Modal DialogWindow
        <br/>
        A data window can be placed on a data window in an owner-child relationship (similar to other controls like check boxes and radio buttons).  When a data window is placed on another data window in this way, it is referred to as a sub-data window.  Note that only a data window can own a sub-data window because it is the only window type of window that can deal with data-related events.
        You can create a data window as a sub-data window when the data window is created.  You can optionally specify a third parameter (&lt;nResourceID&gt;), indicating that the new data window should be created as a control on a window by giving its location and size.  When placed like a control, the data window hides its border decoration and behaves like a sub-data window.  (If this parameter is omitted, the data window is created as a modal DialogWindow, not a sub-data window.)  See DataWindow:Init() for details.
        Tip:  Instead of newly creating a data window, you may prefer to use the Window Editor's Auto Layout feature which — at the touch of a button — automatically creates controls for every available field in a data window's associated data server(s).  See "Using the Window Editor" in the IDE User Guide.
        <br/>
        A data window is connected to a server with the Use() method.  When this connection is established, each control on the window is connected to a field in the data server based on matching names:  a field named CustName is connected to the control named CustName.  The control always reflects the current value of the data in the data server, and assigning a value to a control automatically propagates it to the server.
        Data windows can be associated with data servers in two ways:  in a single server or dual server (master detail) relationship.
        <br/>
        The Master-Detail option allows you to link a window to two data servers in a master-detail relationship.  In this case, a data window is created for the master server with a nested sub-data window for the detail server.
        The field list presented is taken from the Master data server.  The field that you choose is used to perform a SetSelectiveRelation() to the detail server based on its controlling order.  If you do not choose a field, the detail window is updated relative to the current record position in the master window.
        <br/>
        A data window can take on two different view modes:  form view, which contains individual controls for the data fields and browse view, which contains a spreadsheet-like data browser.  The data window can be initially displayed in either mode, and can be switched to the other mode at any time (using the DataWindow:ViewAs() method).  Any data window supports both appearances, although the developer can, of course, choose not to provide a way to select one mode or the other.
        The two view modes provide the same set of facilities:  the same data linkage facilities, the same display options, the same data manipulation methods.  From the perspective of the application, a data window has the same behavior and the same data properties regardless of view mode.
        <br/>
        The standard way of using a data window is to paint its layout in the Window Editor.  This produces a resource entity that specifies what controls the window has, and their locations, sizes, captions, and accelerators.  It also generates a data window subclass and an Init() method that associates names and further annotation with each control.  With such a predefined layout, the window is displayed very quickly and the methods of the window have enough information to act intelligently.
        <br/>
        A data window can also be created without a resource entity.  In this case, the layout of controls on the window is automatically generated when the window is connected to a data server.  After a layout is automatically generated, the window has exactly the same behavior that it has with a resource-based instantiation.
        If a data window is switched over to a new view mode, and the new mode has not been defined through a resource entity or programmatically, the data window automatically creates a layout based on the characteristics of the connected data server.  The new layout picks up all information about fields and controls that is known to the other view; thus, if complex validation rules, prompts, and help have been specified for the individual controls in form view, the columns of the browse view inherit the same properties.
        <br/>
        When a control is connected to a field in a data server, a value entered into the control or assigned to the appropriate name from the program is automatically propagated to the server.  Thus, after executing this statement:
        <code language="X#">oCustomerWindow:CustName := x</code>
        the CustName field in the server has the correct value.
        Values are propagated up from the data server to the data window when the server repositions itself, or when another window makes a change.  This requires no special action: after executing a Skip() method or assigning a value to a field, every window connected to the server is automatically updated to reflect the change.
        <br/>
        Data entered by the user is automatically validated using the rules of the field specification attached to a control or column.  (For more detail on the validation rules provided, see the FieldSpec class.)  If data fails the validation test, the data window will not propagate invalid information down to the server or to other windows, nor will it take any action that requires writing the invalid value to the server.
        In addition to the field-specific validations, the system allows the specification of a ValidateRecord() method for the window as a whole, for the purpose of cross-field validation.  This method, if provided, is called after all the fields have passed their individual validations.
        The data window also provides for registering controls that are subject to the validation status.  Such registered controls are disabled whenever the window's validation status is bad.
        <br/>
        The data window class also provides action methods that correspond to the general capabilities of all data servers: GoTop(), GoTo(), GoBottom(), SkipNext(), SkipPrevious(), Append(), Delete(), and so on.  The data window versions of these methods verify the validation status of the controls on the window.  If everything is valid, the window invokes the corresponding method of the data server.
        <br/>
        The data window provides built-in facilities for concurrency control, automatically taking and releasing record locks as appropriate.  Once the appropriate mode has been selected by assigning one of the available modes to DataWindow:ConcurrencyControl, record movements and changes use the concurrency control facilities of the data server to take and release locks.  If taking a lock fails because another user controls the record, the data window action fails.

        Hold the file name and path for a .DBF file and provide DBF-related functions, such as creating, copying, deleting, moving, and renaming files.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        A FileSpec is a general purpose object that holds the file name and path of a file.  The DBFileSpec subclass is intended specifically for holding information about a DBF file.
        The FileSpec class does not contain any methods for reading or writing the file, however you can in fact create a DBF structure with this class; it is limited to directory-level properties such as size, date and time changed and operations such as delete and rename.  The DBFileSpec adds two operations that apply to DBF files only:  reading the record layout through DBFileSpec:DBStruct and creating a file given a record layout through DBFileSpec:Create().
        Note that a DBServer object opens an existing file on instantiation; it requires that the file exists, so it cannot be used to create a DBF file.  DBFileSpec:Create() is the ideal method for creating a DBF file.
        DBStruct is available as a access method of the DBServer class, but instantiating a DBServer is an unnecessary complex way of reading a file header.  DBFileSpec:DBStruct is a simpler way of getting the record layout.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The two methods may be used together, in concert with the path manipulation methods of the FileSpec class.
        For example, to create in the corresponding directory on a different drive a new file with the same record layout as an existing file, you might do something like this:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBFileSpec := DBFileSpec{"c:\data\custdata.dbf"}
          IF oDBFileSpec:Find()&#0009;&#0009;// File exists?
          &#0009;aDBStruct := oDBFileSpec:DBStruct
          &#0009;oDBFileSpec:Drive := "d:"
          &#0009;oDBFileSpec:Create(aDBStruct)

      <remarks>
        Once a DBF table is opened in a DBServer object, it can be manipulated through the methods of the DBServer class, several of which are shown in the following examples:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBCust := DBServer{"customer"}
          oDBCust:Skip(3)
          ? oDBCust:CustName
          oDBCust:CustNo := NewNumber
          oDBCust:GoTo(86)
          oDBCust:Delete()
          oDBCust:Append()
          oDBCust:Close()
        </code>
        <br/>
        The fields of the table can be considered as exported instance variables of the object.  They can also be accessed through the FieldGet() and FieldPut() methods, with the field identified through a symbol, a string, or a number:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBCust := DBServer{"customer"}
          oDBCust:CustNo := 1234
          ? oDBCust:CustNo
          oDBCust:FieldPut(#CustNo, 1234)
          oDBCust:FieldPut("CustNo", 1234)
          oDBCust:FieldPut(1, 1234)
          ? oDBCust:FieldGet(#CustNo)
          ? oDBCust:FieldGet("CustNo")
          ? oDBCust:FieldGet(1)
        </code>
        (The fields are, of course, not real exported variables of the DBServer class.  See "Objects, Classes, and Methods" in the Programmer's Guide  for a discussion of how these "virtual" exported variables are created using the NoIVarGet() and NoIVarPut() methods.)
        <br/>
        All the traditional database operations available through commands or functions are available as methods for the DBServer object.  In general, they behave the same way, with two exceptions:  expanded parameter types and general scope-setting.
        <br/>
        Whenever an operation requires the specification of a file, an alias, a work area, or a field, the methods accept an object of the corresponding class:  a FileSpec object for a file, a DBServer object for an alias or a work area, or a DataField object for a field.  These options allow a more consistent use of objects and all the benefits they convey.  The new, object-oriented approach is not required:  a file can be specified as either an object or a string, an alias as an object, string or symbol, fields as objects, strings, or symbols.
        <br/>
        The classical SetRelation() operation allows you to link to servers, so that a movement in the parent server causes an automatic movement in the child server.  The prototypical situation is a relation between a customer server and an order server, to make the order server show the orders for the current customer:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBCust := DBServer{"customer"}
          oDBCust:SetIndex("custname")
          oDBOrder := DBServer{"order"}
          oDBOrder:SetIndex("ordcstno")
          oDBCust:SetRelation(oDBOrder,#CustNo)
        </code>
        After this relation is established, any movement in the parent of the relationship causes a corresponding repositioning of the client:  moving to customer Jones positions the order database at the first of Jones's orders, if any.  The DBServer:SetRelation() method works exactly the same as the corresponding command and function in traditional Xbase DML.
        However, this type of relation is not very helpful.  The child database is positioned correctly at the beginning of the orders, but it is not limited at the end of the orders.  Thus, the application that uses the server must continually check if it is still on the appropriate customer's orders.  DBServer:SetFilter() is not very helpful, because if you skip past the last of the customer's orders, DBServer:Skip() continues to scan the file until it finds one that matches.  This kind of behavior is particularly burdensome for general purpose tools like data windows, which have to express these tests in a general way while they provide for data browsing.
        This is where a selective relation is more valuable.  If we establish a selective relation, all operations on the child server are restricted to those records that match.  DBServer:GoTop(), DBServer:GoBottom(), DBServer:BOF, DBServer:EOF, and DBServer:Skip() act as if the only records that exist are those that match the relation.  Specifically, if you try to skip past the last appropriate order, Skip() fails and returns an end-of-file condition.  Similarly, if you try to GoTo() a record that doesn't match, GoTo() fails as if that record didn't exist and stays on the current record.  And utilities like Eval(), Count(), Sum(), etc., by default apply only to the selection (although explicitly specified scopes are allowed to violate this restriction).
        <code language="X#">
          LOCAL aSum
          oDBCust := DBServer{"customer"}
          oDBCust:SetIndex("custname")
          oDBOrder := DBServer{"order"}
          oDBOrder:SetIndex("ordcstno")
          oDBCust:SetSelectiveRelation(oDBOrder,#CustNo)
          oDBCust:Seek("Jones")
          DO WHILE ! oDBOrder:EOF
          &#0009;? oDBOrder:OrderNumber
          ENDDO
          aSum := oDBOrder:Sum(#Charge)
          ? "Number of orders:",oDBOrder:RecCount

        Several Xbase database commands provide a number of options for specifying the scope of the operation through keywords: ALL, REST, NEXT &lt;nRecords&gt;, RECORD &lt;nRecord&gt;, as well as through FOR and WHILE clauses.  The semantics of these clauses, and how they interact when several are specified, are described under "Using DBF Files" in the Programmer's Guide.
        The corresponding DBServer methods (like Average(), AppendDB(), CopyDB(), Sort(), Sum(), Total(), and others) allow the specification of a FOR clause, a WHILE clause and a scope as arguments in the invocation.  In addition, it is possible to set up a "general server scope" using simple assigns (the corresponding accesses are also provided).  This general scope applies whenever one of these bulk processing methods is invoked without an explicit scope.  This approach can in many cases be more convenient.
        For example, to delete the next five records:
        <code language="X#">
          oDB:Scope := 5&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// NEXT 5 records
          oDB:Delete()
          oDB:Scope := NIL&#0009;&#0009;// Don't forget to reset the scope!
        </code>
        For example, to delete all the remaining records:
        <code language="X#">
          oDB:Scope := DBScopeRest&#0009;&#0009;// REST
          oDB:Delete()
          oDB:Scope := NIL&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// Don't forget to reset the scope!
        </code>
        To count the number of Smiths in New Jersey:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBCust:SetOrder("CustomerName")&#0009;// ORDER by name
          oDBCust:Seek("Smith")&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// FIND first Smith
          oDBCust:WhileBlock := {||CustomerName = "Smith"}
          &#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// WHILE still on the Smiths...
          oDBCust:ForBlock := {||State = "NJ"}&#0009;// FOR &#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// customers
          &#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// in NJ...
          Tally := oDBCust:Count()&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// COUNT 'em!
          oDBCust:ClearScope()&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// RESET everything
        </code>
        Remember to restore the scope afterwards:  the scope is persistent and applies to all following scope-based methods until reset.  The convenience of this style of specifying a scope comes with the danger of leaving it active for too long.  The scope can be reset with the DBServer:ClearScope() method, or by assigning NIL to the individual components.
        The general server scope can be set with:
        Property &#0009;Meaning
        ForBlock&#0009;A string or codeblock specifying the FOR condition.
        Scope&#0009;DBSCOPEALL, DBSCOPEREST or a number &lt;nRecords&gt; (meaning NEXT &lt;nRecords&gt;).
        WhileBlock&#0009;A string or codeblock specifying the WHILE condition.
        Note that there is no provision for specifying a specific record number with this approach.  There is rarely a need to process a specific record (e.g., the average of the salary of record 5).  In cases where there is, such as for Delete(), use RecNo :=  &lt;n&gt;, GoTo(&lt;n&gt;) or Seek(&lt;Value&gt;) to position the server, and then invoke Delete().

        The default scope is, of course, "no scope," so these methods have the same default behavior as the corresponding commands and functions.  Most of them process all records or all remaining records, depending on how the scope is defined; those for which the default is "the current record" also have corresponding "all" methods:
        <list type="table">
          <listheader>

        But note that if a selective relation has been specified, the default source scope is the selection, not the entire file.  Thus, we have four levels of inheritance with regard to the scope of an operation:
        1.&#0009;The scope that explicitly specified through arguments of the call
        2.&#0009;If none was provided, the scope that is set through the ForBlock, WhileBlock and Scope properties
        3.&#0009;If none was set, the selection specified with the selective relation
        4.&#0009;If no selective relation is active, the entire file
        The exceptions Delete() and Recall() use options 1 and 2, then default to the current record.  DeleteAll() and RecallAll() apply to the current selection, if any; otherwise, to the entire file.  Of course, a selection scope is not relevant to the Append... methods, for which the conditions apply to the source file, not this server.
        <br/>
        The DBServer Editor generates a subclass of the generic DBServer class, one with specific information such as file names and virtual fields created as access/assign methods.
        <br/>
        It is not possible to use the DBServer class to create a database file; the file must exist before a server can be opened on it.  To create a database file, use the DBCreate() (recommended) method, the VODBCreate() function, or the DBServer Editor.
        <br/>
        This section describes the shared access and aliasing mechanisms used when creating multiple DBServer work areas or servers, as well as hybrid object/procedural operation.
        <br/>
        &#0009;Work area
        &#0009;Creating a DBServer object opens a database in a work area.  There is no provision for specifying whether a new or existing work area should be used; the DBServer always uses a new work area.
        <br/>
        &#0009;After the instantiation, the new work area is not selected; the work area that was selected before the instantiation remains active.  Thus, traditional database commands and functions issued after the instantiation of the DBServer does not apply to the newly opened database.  The proper way to operate on the new DBServer is through its methods.
        &#0009;Shared access
        &#0009;Creating two DBServer objects on the same database file is equivalent to opening the same file in two different work areas.  The two servers (work areas) each maintain its own position and record locks, and operate as two users sharing access to the same file.
        <br/>
        &#0009;To allow creating two servers on the same database file (opening the same file in two work areas), they must, of course, be opened in shared mode; otherwise the second attempt produces a sharing violation.  However, this does not raise an error condition, it simply stores an invalid status of the object.  Use the DBServer:Status or DBServer:Used properties after the instantiation to verify if a file was successfully opened.
        <br/>
        &#0009;Shared mode can be specified as an instantiation parameter (for example, SetExclusive(FALSE) in the Start() function) or as a system default (see DBServer:Init()).
        &#0009;Alias
        &#0009;When using the methods of the DBServer to work with the database, an alias is not needed; the DBServer object provides the handle by which the database is referenced.  The alias has no role in operating with a DBServer object, but internally the system needs a unique alias for every work area.
        &#0009;The DBServer automatically constructs a unique alias.  If the file is not open in any other work area or server, it uses the file name as the alias in the traditional manner, but if the file is already open, it creates a unique alias by appending a number.  Thus, opening the CUSTOMER file twice would produce the two aliases #Customer and #Customer_1.
        <br/>
        The only reason for explicitly using the alias is to perform "hybrid" operation, using traditional, procedural operations with commands or functions on a DBServer object.  This practice is strongly discouraged, however.  Because the DBServer object may not be aware of what is done through the commands, DBServer methods can malfunction after use of procedural commands.  (For more details, see "Using DBF Files" in the Programmer's Guide.)
        It is possible to retrieve the automatically generated alias from the DBServer object, to enable selection of the work area as the focus of procedural database operations:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBCust := DBServer{"customer"}
          cCust := oDBCust:Alias
          SELECT (cCust)
          SKIP
          DELETE
          ? (cCust) -&gt; CustNo
        </code>
        <br/>
        Most of the changes we made in the RDD classes were made to improve the speed of the RDD classes. One change in particular could influence your application: in the old implementation Visual Objects was restoring the ‘current workarea’ after each DbServer:Method call. This is only useful if you are mixing Object Oriented DBF access with traditional work area oriented DBF access. If all you do is Object Oriented DBF access, the work area switching is unnecessary and may have a negative impact on your applications performance.
        Therefore we have added a switch to the RDD classes that allows you do enable/disable this restore mechanism. The default for Visual Objects 2.8 is to NOT restore the workarea. The switch is in the function:
        <code language="X#">DbSetRestoreWorkarea (lEnable)</code>
        This is a global switch, which changes the behaviour of the DBServer class.
        The default value of the lEnable switch is FALSE which means that workarea restoring is disabled. As a result of this at the end of each DbServer method the current workarea is the workarea of the DBServer.
        If you set the lEnable flag to TRUE every DBServer method restores the workarea at the end of the method to the value of the work area at the beginning of the method. This is the old behavior, but costs some extra time.
        The return value of DbSetRestoreWorkarea () is the previous value.
        If lEnable is NIL the switch is not set and SetRestoreWorkarea() returns only the current value.
        DbSetRestoreWorkarea () also changes the internal behaviour of the new internal function __DBSetSelect(siNew). If you call DbSetRestoreWorkarea (TRUE) which is the default __DBSetSelect() is identical to VODBSetSelect(), if  you call DbSetRestoreWorkarea (FALSE) DBSetSelect() is empty and do nothing.
        <br/>
        <note type="tip">
          There have been some major changes in the DbServer class in VO 2.8. Please read the section on the bottom of this topic carefully if you are migrating from an older version of Visual Objects.

      <summary>
        Create a dialog window (also commonly referred to as a dialog box), which allows the application and end user to interact.  This type of dialog can be modal or modeless (see the description below).
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        Dialog windows are windows that present a collection of controls for user I/O.  They also have a result code that indicates the result of the user-dialog interaction (for example, if the user pressed the OK or Cancel push button in the dialog).
        Most windowing systems distinguish between modal and modeless objects.  Modal objects must be acknowledged before the current thread of execution can continue; conversely, modeless objects do not affect the current execution thread.
        When a dialog box is modal, a further distinction must be made between system modal and application modal objects.  Objects that are system modal must be acknowledged before any execution in any windows created by any currently running application, including the Windows desktop, can continue.  Application modal objects, on the other hand, must be acknowledged before any execution in just the current application can continue (that is, the user can access windows created by other applications).
        By default, a dialog window is application modal.  However, it can be made modeless by assigning FALSE to the &lt;lModal&gt; flag in the DialogWindow:Init() method.  You may also just want to create a modeless dialog box.

      <summary>
        Create the client for use in a drag-and-drop operation.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        In Windows, "drag-and-drop" is a technique by which users can move files from one location to another, either visually (using the mouse) or through another system-accepted method.  The client in a drag-and-drop operation is a utility object with an associated owner window that accepts dropped files.
        Creating a drag-and-drop client automatically makes its owner window capable of accepting drag-and-drop loads.  The event handlers in the drag-and-drop client handle the events relevant to the drag-and-drop operation.
        Important!  When you call Window:EnableDragDropClient(TRUE), the window becomes a DragDropClient and inherits all the methods of DragDropClient.  The callback methods DragLeave(), DragOver(), and Drop() are called on the Window object when a DragLeave, DragOver, or Drop event occurs (see the example below.)
      </remarks>

        The following example demonstrates the use of the DragDropClient class:

        In Windows, "drag-and-drop" is a technique by which users can move files from one location to another, either visually (using the mouse) or through another system-accepted method.  The server in a drag-and-drop operation is the source of the drag-and-drop operation.
        The user normally uses the mouse to select a group of files to drag (however, the application can choose any reasonable metaphor for selection). After selection, the application creates a drag-and-drop load by storing the file names in an array; it then calls the DragDropServer:StartDrag() method.
        When you call Window:EnableDragDropServer(TRUE), the window becomes a DragDropServer.  The DragDropServer is a property in the Window and is called Window:DragDropServer.

      </summary>
      <remarks>
        Drag-and-drop is a GUI convention for moving objects from one place to another.  In Windows, the convention only supports files.  A drag event occurs when the user drags a group of previously selected files to a new location.  Drag events occur in the target window where the selection will be dropped (not in the window where the selection was made).
        <note type="tip">Drag events do not occur in the drag-and-drop server (the source of the files) — only in the drag-and-drop client (the target).  When the drag enters the client area, the drag event goes to the DragDropClient:DragOver() method of the client.  If the drag leaves the client without dropping its files, and the drag-and-drop client has returned TRUE to the DragOver() method, a generic event goes to DragDropClient:DragLeave().  It is then no longer relevant or correct for the application to query the event if it is leaving the client.  If the user drops the files, the drag event goes to DragDropClient:Drop().</note>

        The DrawObject class provides a protocol for drawable objects (for example, the Window class invokes DrawObject's methods to manage a drawable object).  This protocol provides a means to maintain arrays of drawing objects for subsequent display on a window.
        Each object in the DrawObject hierarchy should provide both a BoundingBox property (to identify the smallest area that can enclose the drawing object) and a Draw() method (to specify how the object is to be drawn).  When the application is finished with the object, it must be explicitly destroyed using the Destroy() method.

        The Edit class provides simple text editing facilities for entering, deleting, and selecting text.  In addition, you can specify if edit controls are to have a border, whether they should be read-only, or perhaps whether they should be password protected.
        Edit controls in this class hierarchy treat the text they contain as a series of numbered characters.  In these edit controls, a selection is an ordered pair of character numbers.  For example, if an edit control contains the text "samarkand," the selection (3,7) would select the text "mark."
        Also, for each control, the text limit is the maximum number of characters you wish the edit to hold.
        The non-graphic characters for newline (Chr(10)), tab (Chr(9)), and null (Chr(0)) occupy one character position.

        When an edit control is created as part of the Window hierarchy, it can trap events.  For example, you might want to customize the appearance of edit controls (like changing the background and foreground colors) or modify their default key handling.
        Manipulating a control via the ControlWindow class requires more overhead than those created by the subclasses of Control.  Therefore, it is recommended that control windows be used only where special handling is needed (for example, to override the handling of certain events or call some window method on a control).

        An Error object is a simple object that contains information pertaining to a runtime error.  Error objects have no methods, only exported instance variables.
        When a runtime error occurs, X# creates a new Error object and passes it as an argument to the error handler block specified with the ErrorBlock() function.  Within the error handler, the Error object can then be queried to determine the nature of the error condition.
        Error objects can also be returned to the RECOVER statement of a BEGIN SEQUENCE construct with a BREAK statement.  Similarly, Error objects are also be passed to error methods of DataServer or DataWindow objects.  Here, the Error object can be queried for local error handling.  For more detailed information and examples, see "Error and Exception Handling" in the Programmer's Guide.

        Create an explorer window.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        An explorer window is a two- or four-pane split window that mimics the functionality of Microsoft Windows application windows, such as File Manager or Explorer.  The explorer window contains a list view control and a tree view control, as well as optional fixed text controls.  The programming interfaces for these controls can be used directly to manipulate the window.
        A two-pane explorer window contains a list view and a tree view side-by-side, separated by a vertical split bar that can be dragged.  A four-pane explorer window contains a list view and a tree view side-by-side, with fixed text that serves as a label above each.  The list view and tree view are separated by a vertical split bar that can be dragged.  The fixed text labels are separated from the list view and tree view by a horizontal split bar that cannot be dragged.  Panes are aligned vertically.

      <summary>
        Provide information about an ExposeEvent, used to notify a window that it may need to be repainted.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        An ExposeEvent occurs when a window is:
        &#0009;First shown
        &#0009;Moved or closed
        &#0009;Moving or closing a window exposes the area underneath the window; if any other windows are in this newly exposed area, they need to be repainted.  The system automatically sends these window(s) an ExposeEvent to notify them that they must repaint the area that was uncovered.
        &#0009;Resized
        The ExposeEvent goes to the Window:Expose() event handler with the responsibility for repainting the exposed area.  You should place your own code in this event handler if you want your application to do something when its window is exposed.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following example prints different messages, depending on what part of the window has been exposed:

        Create a file specification, which provides a useful framework for managing file names and paths.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        A file specification is intended as a way of storing and managing name- and path-related information for a file.  It provides some methods for copying, moving, deleting and renaming files, as well as access methods for retrieving information about the file.  If the path is not specified using the assign methods provided by the FileSpec class, it is obtained by the SetDefault() and SetPath() functions.
        This class allows you to manage this data for all different types of files in a common way.  Because of this, it does not provide any methods for processing a file, such as reading and writing it, as such methods would depend on the type of file it is.  For example, .DBF files can be processed with the DBServer object; other files can be processed with either functions or customized FileSpec subclasses that have been customized for handling different types of files.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        File specifications are often used as arguments to DBServer objects and methods.  For example, to copy selected records from one file to another:
        <code language="X#">
          // Source file
          oFSSource := FileSpec{"c:\data\customer"}
          // For the target file, use path of source file
          oFSTarget := FileSpec{oFSSource:FullPath}
          // Change file name for target file
          oFSTarget:FileName := "nycust"
          // Open source file in server object
          oDBSource := DBServer{oFSSource}
          // Copy records to target file
          oDBSource:CopyDB(oFSTarget,,{||STATE="NY"})
        </code>
        A FileSpec object is also a convenient way to find the current directory and then search in subdirectories according to a logical structure:
        <code language="X#">
          oFileSpec := FileSpec{}
          oFileSpec:Path := CurDir()
          oFileSpec:AppendToPath("data")
          oFileSpec:FileName := "custdata"
          oDB := DBServer{oFileSpec}
        </code>

      </summary>
      <remarks>
        When a window comes in or out of focus, the dispatcher generates a FocusChangeEvent and sends it to Window:FocusChange().  When the input focus changes, the window losing the focus gets a FocusChangeEvent (telling it that it is losing the focus) and the window gaining the focus receives a FocusChangeEvent (telling it that it is gaining the focus).
        A window that has focus gets KeyEvents when the user hits the keyboard.  This is similar to an active window, but an active window receives MouseEvents instead of KeyEvents.
        Tip:  Applications using cursors should use FocusChangeEvent to determine whether to create or destroy the cursor.

      <remarks>
        X# provides a set of predefined fonts, defined with the Font:Init() method.  In addition, if desired, you can also create a font by specifying a particular size and style.)
        Although you supply specifics for a new font, the GUI actually picks an actual font which best fits the description provided.
        Each window has a currently selected font.  Window:TextPrint() and Window:SizeText() use this font when they are printing or sizing text.
        <note type="tip">
          Deselecting a Font:&#0009;In Windows, the current font should be deselected before destroying the window.  To do this, use Window:Font to assign the previous font, for example.  However, this is only necessary if there is a font other than the default one currently selected.
          Font Pitch:&#0009;A font's pitch can be either variable or fixed.  In variable pitch fonts, characters are proportionally spaced (for example, a variable pitch font uses more space to print an "M" than an "i").  In fixed pitch fonts, the same amount of space is used by each character, regardless of the character width.  Fixed pitch fonts are most commonly used by terminals and typewriters or to display program text.
          &#0009;&#0009;Variable pitched fonts are not always supported.  This is dependent on the individual font.

        Create a link to the help system in use.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        The HelpDisplay class allows you to easily provide online help for your applications.  The help system resource provided by the GUI can remain in memory until the HelpDisplay object is deleted.  Therefore, before the application terminates, ensure that the HelpDisplay object is either deleted or goes out of scope.
        <br/>
        HelpDisplay provides a way to display help on a given topic.  However, the application still needs a means of determining which topic help is required.
        For large applications, most GUI style guides recommend that help commands be made available from the menu bar.  These commands can be trapped using the MenuCommandEvent handler, and the appropriate help information displayed in response.
        Another approach is to use push buttons to obtain help on specific topics.  Using a push button and the ButtonClick() event handler, you can program the application to display the relevant help information when the Help button is pressed.
        In practice, an application's Help facility should combine menu commands and buttons to provide help.
        <br/>
        Context-sensitive help means the user receives help specific to the current activity when the help key or mouse sequence is chosen.  For example, when responding to a dialog window, the user can want help for the control with the focus.
        X# applications can provide context-sensitive help for:
        &#0009;Particular areas of the screen (such as the caption bar and canvas area)
        &#0009;Menu commands
        &#0009;Controls (like push buttons, edit controls, and toolbar buttons)
        To support a portable context-sensitive help system, X# provides the HelpRequestEvent class, the Window:HelpDisplay property, and the Window:HelpRequest() event handler method.  (HelpRequest() determines the source of the help trigger — that is, the particular item for which help is requested — and passes this information on to the GUI's help system.)
        Refer to the "GUI Classes" chapter in the Programmer's Guide for more information on programming an online help system for your application.
        <note type="tip">
          The EXPORTed variable DefaultPageOnContents is a LOGIC which defaults to TRUE. It is used to determine whether the default page should be shown when HelpContents is requested. If set to FALSE, 'HelpContents' will display the Contents tab but leave the current topic displayed. For HTML Help only.

      <remarks>
        There are two types of horizontal scroll bars in X#: regular (created with CLASS HorizontalScrollBar) and window (created with the AppWindow:EnableHorizontalScroll() method).
        Both types have an owner window and can be manipulated using Window:HorizontalScroll().  However, a window horizontal scroll bar differs in that it automatically appears aligned along the bottom of its owner window's canvas area and also resizes itself according to the size of its owner window.
        A horizontal scroll bar allows the user to update a short integer numeric value by either moving the thumb position, clicking on the button at either end of the scroll bar to change the number by the designated ScrollBar:UnitSize, or by clicking in the interior of the scroll bar to change the number by the designated ScrollBar:BlockSize.  The minimum and maximum allowable numeric values are indicated by the Min and Max values for the Range object associated with the scroll bar.  The ScrollBar:Value access indicates the currently selected numeric value.  A scroll bar may be bound to a numeric field in a server.
        <note type="tip">By default, Window:HorizontalScroll() updates the thumb position (the marker on the scroll bar that can be dragged up or down, left or right) in the scroll bar.  If desired, you can change this by using your own implementation of this handler.</note>
        <br/>
        In Windows, horizontal scroll bars are equivalent to a scroll bar with the SBS_HORZ style.  They are normally specified in the resource entity as follows:
        <code language="X#">
          RESOURCE IDD_ABOUT DIALOG 20, 20, 160, 120
          STYLE WS_POPUP | WS_DLGFRAME

      </summary>
      <remarks>
        The HyperLabel class stores prompts and instructions for context-sensitive help information about another object — the host object.  The purpose of the class is to collect this kind of information in a standard way so that the various help systems (status, exception, and error management functions) within the system can process the hyperlabel without knowing anything about the host object, just as a mailing system routes packages without knowing their content.
        Hyperlabels also record the symbolic name of the host.  For example, the system uses this name to match fields with controls when linking a data window to a data source and, in the case of menu commands, to decide which method of the menu's owner to dispatch when the user commands that menu command to execute.
        Individual database columns have hyperlabels, as do data types, data windows, controls, and menu commands.  Objects delegate hyperlabels to one another.  In fact a large part of good programming with X# consists in providing full and helpful hyperlabels.  Much of the automatic behavior of the system depends for its progress on the quality of information in the hyperlabels.
        It is called a hyperlabel because the system's hypertext help system navigates by hyperlabels.
        <note type="tip">You first create a hyperlabel and then affix it to its host object by assigning to the host's hyperlabel pseudo-variable.</note>

      <remarks>
        The intention of this class is that the text would appear as a HyperLink to a www address or as an @ email address and therefore the cursor will appear as the normal hand.
        When the control is clicked on, it will attempt to "open" the text of the control using the OpenLink callback method. If the text is a www address it will open the default browser and attempt to navigate to the address. If the text contains an @ it will be taken as an email address and open the default email client.
        <note type="tip">
          The difference between the HyperLink and the SysLink classes is in the way that the text is used.
          In a HyperLink control, ALL of the text is passed as the hyperlink where as in the SysLink control you can mix display text and hyperlink text.
          Also, in the HyperLink control, ALL of the displayed text is passed through to the ShellExecute method and you must make sure that there is nothing in it which could cause this to fail.

      </summary>
      <remarks>
        X# provides a set of predefined icons, defined in Icon:Init().  Use the AppWindow:Icon property to assign an icon for each application window.
        Visual Object includes an Icon Editor which produces standard system icon files.  There is also a large library of system icons.  These icon files are compatible with the standard format on the system, so any other icon file or Icon Editor may also be used.  To use such an icon file, create an icon resource with the RESOURCE statement and reference it when instantiating an icon.  Refer to the IDE User Guide for more information on using and editing the standard icons.
        <note type="tip">An icon's size and color range is system-dependent.</note>
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following example demonstrates the use of one of the standard icons:
        <code language="X#">
          CLASS MyWindow INHERIT TopAppWindow
          METHOD Init() CLASS MyWindow
          &#0009;SUPER:Init()
          &#0009;SELF:Icon := Icon{ICONASTERISK}
        </code>
        This code fragment emphasizes three things:
        &#0009;Any Init() method of a class that inherits must call SUPER:Init().
        &#0009;The pseudo-variable Icon is an access/assign pair in class AppWindow.
        &#0009;ICONASTERISK identifies one of the standard icons.
        The following example provides an application window with a custom icon:
        <code language="X#">
          CLASS MyTopAppWin INHERIT TopAppWindow
          METHOD Init CLASS MyTopAppWin
          &#0009;SUPER:Init()
          &#0009;SELF:Icon := Icon{IDI_APPICON}
          RESOURCE IDI_APPICON ICON app.ico
        </code>
        <br/>
        In Windows, icons are defined in a resource entity using the keyword ICON, referencing the name of the file created by the Icon Editor.

        List boxes and combo boxes display a list of items or choices to the user.  The list box methods will allow you to add, arrange, remove, and interrogate the list of items.  When one of the items is selected, ListBox:CurrentItem, ListBox:CurrentItemNo, ListBox:TextValue, and ListBox:Value are updated.  Either a one-dimensional or two-dimensional array is specified in the FillUsing() method, with a row for each of the items available for selection.  With a two-dimensional array, the first element is called the display value, and the second element is called the return value.  When an item is selected, ListBox:TextValue contains the first element (the display value), and ListBox:Value contains the second element (the return value).  If no item is selected, ListBox:TextValue is NULL_STRING and ListBox:Value is NIL.
        A list box may be bound to a field (character, date, logical, numeric, or memo) in a server.  The field's data value is stored in ListBox:Value.  The list box compares the data value to the second element values specified in the FillUsing() array, and if a match is found, the first element (the display value) is stored in ListBox:TextValue.  In a "no-match" situation, the list box shows no item selected, ListBox:CurrentItem is NULL_STRING, ListBox:CurrentItemNo is set to 0, and ListBox:TextValue and ListBox:Value reflect the field contents.  If an item is selected, ListBox:CurrentItemNo is set to a number between 1 and ListBox:ItemCount, and the corresponding second element is stored as ListBox:Value and as the field's data value.
        <note type="tip">All array index references start at 1.</note>
        You can also create a multiple selection list box, which allows you to manage multiple items within a list box.  Any number of items in a list box can be selected together (referred to as multiple selection).  Each item is toggled on/off each time the user clicks on it.
        A multiple selection list box is created by selecting the LBOXMULTIPLESEL style when creating a ListBox object.  Certain properties and methods of this class apply specifically to multiple selection list boxes, including SelectedCount access, ChangeSelected(), ClearSelection(), DeselectItem(), FirstSelected(), NextSelected(), and SelectItem().

      <summary>
        Create a menu.  Menus consist of items which the user selects for execution; a menu item can be a string, a bitmap, or another menu.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        Menus provide the highest level of user control within an application.  At the most basic level, a menu is series of items that are displayed in the menu bar (for example, the strings "OpenFile", a question mark bitmap to indicate help, and so on.)  When selected, these items perform an action — for example, open a file, exit the application, or get help.
        The items in a menu bar might also contain a submenu as another type of item.  When creating a submenu, you generally specify a title (this is the text that appears in the menu bar) and the set of items that belong to that submenu (the items are displayed when the title is activated in the menu bar).  For example, a submenu might have the title "File" and items named "Open," "Save," and "Exit."
        Like menus, submenus can contain strings, bitmaps, and other menus.  Using submenus allows you to have multi-dimensional menus.  In addition, just like any menu, they can be created from a resource entity.
        Each item on a menu is identified by a unique ID.  You can then use that ID to refer to the item later in your program (for example, to disable or delete an item).
        Menu commands can be selected with the mouse or with an accelerator key, and can be added, deleted, inserted, and appended as required.
        Items on a menu can be dimmed (or grayed) to indicate that they are disabled, and they can be checked to indicate that they are enabled/selected.  You can also add separators to a menu.  (A separator is a single line inserted between items on a submenu to group similar commands together.)
        A menu is usually associated with an accelerator table that defines shortcuts (like Ctrl+S for File Save) and a toolbar that provides certain buttons issuing commonly used menu commands.  The toolbar and accelerators are usually carried by the menu;  assigning a menu to a window automatically assigns the toolbar and accelerators as well.
        <br/>
        Menus in X# generate the following events — MenuInitEvent, MenuSelectEvent, and MenuCommandEvent.  They are dispatched to the window that owns the menu that generated the event.
        The event handler methods for these events are as follows:
        &#0009;Window:MenuInit() is called before a menu is displayed.
        &#0009;Window:MenuSelect() is called when a menu command is highlighted.
        &#0009;When the user selects a menu command for execution, the window method that matches the menu command's name is called, if any.  If there is no matching method, Window:MenuCommand() is called.  Menu commands are also propagated up the window ownership hierarchy.  For an in depth discussion of how command events are used, refer to the Programmer's Guide.
        <br/>
        In the Windows, menus are normally created in resource entities.  (You can also construct menus dynamically using the Append... or Insert... methods of Menu.)
        For example, in Windows, menus can be created in a resource entity as follows:
        <code language="X#">
          RESOURCE IDM_DEMO MENU
          BEGIN
          &#0009;POPUP "&amp;File"
          &#0009;BEGIN
          &#0009;&#0009;MENUITEM "&amp;New",&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;IDMI_NEW
          &#0009;&#0009;MENUITEM "&amp;Open...",&#0009;&#0009;IDMI_OPEN
          &#0009;&#0009;MENUITEM "&amp;Save",&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;IDMI_SAVE
          &#0009;&#0009;MENUITEM "Save &amp;As...",&#0009;&#0009;IDMI_SAVEAS
          &#0009;&#0009;MENUITEM SEPARATOR
          &#0009;&#0009;MENUITEM "E&amp;xit",&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;IDMI_EXIT
          &#0009;&#0009;MENUITEM "A&amp;bout Demo...",&#0009;IDMI_ABOUT
          &#0009;END
          END
        </code>
        The easiest way to construct a menu is by using the Menu Editor.  It generates the resource, as illustrated in the example above, as well as the subclass used to instantiate the menu, the accelerator table, and the toolbar.

      <remarks>
        MenuCommandEvent events are passed to Window:MenuCommand(), which dispatches the method indicated in the menu item's hyperlabel.

      <summary>
        Provide information about a MenuInitEvent, generated when the user first activates a menu for the first time.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        The system generates MenuInitEvent objects before displaying a pull-down menu, allowing the application to initialize items before they are displayed.  For example, you can want to dim items that the program is not yet in a position to handle, or you may want to check or uncheck certain items.  MenuInitEvent events are passed to Window:MenuInit().
        If you change the menu using the Menu access, you do not need to call the window's Menu assign.  When the menu is displayed, it is the modified version.
        Accelerator keys generate MenuInitEvent events if the accelerator invokes a submenu.

        Provide information about a MenuSelectEvent, generated whenever a menu item is highlighted on a menu (menu items are highlighted as the user moves either the mouse or the highlight bar up or down a menu).
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        MenuSelectEvent events enable the program to anticipate that the user can activate an item or to provide status information.
        <note type="tip">When a menu item is actually selected (and therefore executed), the system generates a MenuCommandEvent.</note>
        When an accelerator key is executed, a MenuSelectEvent, immediately followed by a MenuCommandEvent, is generated to simulate the mouse route — the various selections that you have to pass over to choose the option.  (Thus, the accelerator generates the same event as those generated with a mouse.)

        While it is often very convenient to create automation servers at runtime on the fly, you might also want to consider generating base classes for specific automation servers using the Automation Server generator in the IDE.  Generated OLE automation server base classes inherit from OLEAutoObject and provide compile-time information about the particular server, thereby introducing compile-time checking and speeding up method invocations at runtime.
        Internally this class uses an array of method description objects (type cOleMethod) to store the descriptions of the properties and methods that an OleAutomation server supports.

      <remarks>
        Important!  In order for this class to work the automation server must implement the IPersistFile interface — most automation servers do not.
        The OLEAutoObjectFromFile class lets you create an automation server object from a file.  OLE will determine which automation server a particular file belongs to and automatically start the server and open the file inside it.

      <remarks>
        This class is used to pass binary information to an OleServer, such as the contents of a file. In most cases the Ole Server will expect an array of butes. VO will generate an array of bytes for each OleBinary Argument.
        <note type="tip">
          VO 2.8 SP2 introduces this class. However: this patch does not come with a new repository, so you cannot directly reference the class but must use the CreateInstance() syntax in stead.

      <remarks>
        The OLEControl class implements a wrapper and container for an OLE control (OCX, ActiveX).  An OLE control is basically an OLE object with an added automation interface, by which you can program the OCX and set up event handlers to handle events instantiated by the OLE control.  To cover the first requirement, OLEControl is derived from OLEObject and, therefore, inherits all of the OLEObject's functionality.  The automation interface is provided by an OLEAutoObject, which is a protected member variable of OLEControl initialized using OLEControl:InitAutoObject().

        X# supports the ability to store an OLE object in a DBF database.  To assign a new value to the OLEObject container, you pass an OLEDBStorage object to OLEObject:CreateFromDBStorage().  To save an OLE object in the database, you pass an OLEDBStorage object to OLEObject:SaveToDBStorage().  You usually get the OLEDBStorage object as a result of a FieldGet() call.

      <summary>
        Provide a container and wrapper for an OLE object.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        The OLEObject class serves as the container and wrapper for an OLE object, provided and managed by an OLE server.  The OLEObject alone is simply a windowed control that can take exactly one OLE object.  The OLE object is created via one of the Create methods, such as OLEObject:CreateFromPasteDialog() or OLEObject:CreateFromAppDocStorage().  Several properties, such as OLEObject:AllowInPlace, control the basic behavior of the OLEObject.
        Note the distinction between OLEObject, which is a class provided by X#, and an OLE object, which is provided by its server and "lives" inside the OLEObject container.  Using OLEObject:DetachFromServer(), the current OLE object can be destroyed, but the same OLEObject container can be reused by calling one of the Create methods again.

      <remarks>
        Instantiation requires a DBFileSpec object.  Each order will require a separate OrderSpec object. <br/> 
        For single-order index formats such as DBFNTX, this is equivalent to one OrderSpec object per physical file.  <br/> 
        For multi-order index formats such as DBFCDX, this would mean multiple OrderSpec objects for one physical file.<br/>

        X# provides a set of predefined pens, which are specified in the Pen:Init() method (the default color and width is used).  In addition, if desired, you can also create a brush by specifying a color, line style, and width.
        Each window has a current pen, which can be set or changed using the Window:Pen property.  A window's pen is used in subsequent line and rectangle drawing operations, and should not be deleted while it is the current selection.

      <remarks>
        X# provides a set of predefined pointers, defined in Pointer:Init().  In addition, if desired, you can also create pointers from resource entities.
        Each window can have its own pointer, and various pointer characteristics can be set, changed, or interrogated.  As the pointer moves from the canvas area of one window to another, the GUI changes the pointer representation to that of the new window.
        Tip:  In X#, the class Pointer corresponds to a mouse cursor; use class Cursor to create text cursors.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following example provides an application window with a custom cursor:

      <remarks>
        It is essential to check the validity of a Printer object — using Printer:IsValid() — before using it.
        To use a printer, the application should call Printer:Start(), which repeatedly calls Printer:PrinterExpose() for each page printed until the final page, in which it returns FALSE.  Printer:Start() returns when the print job is finished.
        You can also:
        &#0009;Determine the size of the page using Window:CanvasArea and Window:WindowArea to return the size of the printable area and total page size, respectively
        &#0009;Scale the printout using Window:Size
        &#0009;Determine the origin using Window:Origin (for example, to create margins)
        X# will only print the correct font if it exists for your printer; otherwise, the font that is most similar is used.
        Printing is done in printer coordinates, which are device dependent.  Use the methods described here to scale and size your printout.  Also note that for business printing, such as management reports, invoices, and notification letters, it is usually more convenient to design a report with the Report Editor and then run the report using the ReportQueue class.  For more information, refer to the Programmer's Guide.

        By default, the event handler displays a text box for the "no disk space" message.  The error handler does not abort automatically, but prompts the user to abort or retry.  If the user retries, the system returns control to the Print Manager.  However, the device drivers of some printers can prohibit such a message.

      <remarks>
        Radio buttons are typically presented in related groups and provide mutually exclusive responses to a condition where only one choice is appropriate.  (For example, a group of radio buttons might allow you to choose Inches, Centimeters, or Picas.)
        Only one radio button can be on in each radio button group.  When a different button is pressed, the previously selected button is turned off.  In the Window Editor, the Group style setting is checked for each radio button group, to designate the first control in each group.  If you do not explicitly create two or more groups, then there will be only one group for the entire window and only one radio button may be selected at a time.
        A radio button is said to be "pressed" when it is filled in, and the RadioButton:Pressed access is TRUE.  Like check boxes, radio buttons maintain their state between events.  When you create a radio button group using the Window Editor, code is generated so that it functions automatically.  The caption is used to indicate which button in the group is pressed, and the selected button's group value is stored in the RadioButton:Value.
        Radio buttons may not be bound to a field in a server, like other controls.  Instead, a radio button group may be bound to a field.
        <br/>
        In Windows, radio buttons are equivalent to a button with the BS_RADIOBUTTON style.  The style BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON is also very useful because the button is automatically turned on and off without any code being written in the system's Window:ButtonClick() event handler.
        In Windows, radio buttons can be created in a resource entity as follows:

      <summary>
        A group of radio buttons considered as a combination control, presenting a set of options and returning a single value.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        Radio buttons are commonly used to allow selection of one among a specific list of options.  However, treating several radio buttons as individual controls requires explicit management of the behavior of the buttons:  when one is selected, the program must turn off the other buttons in the group.  Individual radio buttons are also not suited for linking to a database:  databases typically do not have several fields representing linked properties, but rather a single field that can take on different values.
        The radio button group is a higher level control that automatically handles the interlinking of the buttons.  It also links to database fields in a more intelligent way than individual radio buttons:  the group as a whole is considered as one control that takes one of a number of specific values.
        Since the radio button group is the control that you deal with, and its constituent radio buttons are not directly referenced by the program, properties such as the hyperlabel, field specification, caption, value, and text value are attached to the group.  The value is either the number of the radio button which is currently selected in the sequence or one of the values specified for a radio button in a two-dimensional array through FillUsing().  The text value is the same value formatted according to the picture clause of the field specification attached to the group (to get the caption displayed next to the radio buttons, retrieve the selected button and reference its caption property.  Note that the data type and picture of the group's field specification are used and the field specs of the individual radio buttons are ignored.
        The radio button group behaves similarly to a list box or combo box and may be used as an alternative to any constrained single-selection list box when the number of options is small and fixed.  (Although the radio button group supports variable caption strings for the individual buttons, a list box is usually a better choice for very dynamic data.)
        A radio button group is created empty and radio buttons are associated with it through the FillUsing() method.  If you create a radio button using the Window Editor, the FillUsing( ) method in the generated source code defines a two-dimensional array, with one row for each button.  The first element contains the caption of the radio button and the second element contains its group value.   When a button is pressed, the radio button group's TextValue contains the first element (the button caption), and Value contains the second element (the group value).  If no button is pressed, RadioButtonGroup:TextValue is NULL_STRING and RadioButtonGroup:Value is NIL.
        A radio button group may be bound to a field in a server.  The field's data value is stored in RadioButtonGroup:Value.  The radio button group compares the field's data value to the second element values specified in the FillUsing() array, and if a match is found, the first element (the button caption) is stored in RadioButtonGroup:TextValue.  If there is no match, RadioButtonGroup:TextValue is NULL_STRING.  If a button is pressed, the corresponding second element is stored as RadioButtonGroup:Value, and this value is written to the server.

          METHOD Expose(oEvent) CLASS MyWindow
          &#0009;LOCAL oRectangle AS OBJECT
          &#0009;oRectangle := RectangleObject{Point{10,10},;
          &#0009;&#0009;Dimension{20,40}}
          &#0009;SELF:Draw(oRectangle)

      <summary>
        Provide the base class from which all X# scroll bars are subclassed.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        Scroll bars have a marker, called a thumb, which can be dragged up and down (or left and right) within a range of values.  The thumb can be dragged to different positions on the scroll bar, or it can step up or down in blocks or units.
        GUI scroll bars automatically maintain block and unit operations.  When a block or unit operation takes place, a ScrollEvent is generated with both the actual thumb position and the position the thumb would assume if the scroll bar is updated.  The block and unit amounts are added or subtracted from the current position according to the scroll type that occurs.
        By default, a scroll bar has a range of (0,99), a unit size of 1, a block size of 10, and an initial thumb position of 0.
      </remarks>
    </member>
    <member name="T:VO.ScrollEvent">
      <summary>
        Provide information about a ScrollEvent, generated when a scroll bar is manipulated.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        ScrollEvent events go to either Window:VerticalScroll() or Window:HorizontalScroll(), depending on whether a vertical or horizontal scroll bar generated the event.
        A ScrollEvent reports the following:  what scroll bar caused the event, what type of scroll movement is requested, and whether the scroll bar is a window or a free-standing scroll bar.
        It also reports the old scroll bar position and the desired position.  The old position is where the thumb was located before being manipulated by the user; the desired position is where the user has newly positioned the thumb (if the thumb is manipulated directly or calculated from the block and unit sizes).
      </remarks>
      <example>
        Normally, when you receive a ScrollEvent, you would update the scroll bar's thumb position with code similar to the following:
        <code language="X#">aScrollEvt:ScrollBar:ThumbPosition := aScrollEvt:Position</code>

    <member name="T:VO.Selection">
      <summary>
        Create a selection, which represents the start and end of a text selection in an edit control as an ordered pair.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        Selections are used in edit controls (i.e., by the Edit and EditWindow classes).  The start of a selection is the position in the edit control of the first character that is included in the selection.  The finish is the position of the first character not in the selection.  For example, to specify the text from position 5 through 9 inclusive, you would give a value of Selection{5,10}.
        To select all the characters in an edit control (such as a single-line edit control), you would specify a value of Selection{0,-1}.
        If the start and finish points are the same, the selection refers to a cursor position.  For example, the cursor position in front of the fifth character would be referred to as Selection{5,5}.

    <member name="T:VO.ShellWindow">
      <summary>
        Create a shell window, which provides MDI support for your applications.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        A shell window is similar to a top application window except that it acts as an MDI client window and all children of this window act as MDI child windows.
        <br/>
        The style of a child window is determined by the type of its owner.  By default, a child application window whose owner is a shell window automatically functions as an MDI child window.  If you do not desire this behavior, you can inhibit it using the ChildAppWindow:Init().
        <br/>
        When a child window is activated, its menu is automatically placed on the parent window.  When there are no open child windows, the parent's menu is used.  MenuCommand events are sent to any currently active child window.  If there is no active child window, the default event handler sends events to the parent.  For an in-depth discussion on event propagation, refer to the Programmer's Guide.
        <br/>
        With MDI applications, there is typically one pull-down menu which contains the captions of currently open MDI child windows.  The name of the currently active MDI window is checked on the menu; also, when the user selects one of the names on this menu, the system activates the corresponding MDI window.
        Use the Menu:SetAutoUpdate() method to specify which pull-down menu to use.

    <member name="T:VO.SplitWindow">
      <summary>
        Create a split window.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        A split window provides a simple and easy way to create a window that can be split into several pane windows separated by split bars that can be dragged to resize the panes.  Each pane can specify a client window or control, which is automatically sized to fit into the pane.
        A Dimension object is used to configure the layout of the split window panes.  The width specifies the number of panes across (horizontally), and the height specifies the number of panes up and down (vertically).  Panes are numbered from left to right and top to bottom.  For example, a split window with a layout of Dimension{4, 3} is arranged as follows:
        1&#0009;2&#0009;3&#0009;4
        5&#0009;6&#0009;7&#0009;8
        9&#0009;10&#0009;11&#0009;12
        The maximum total number of panes is 16.
        <note type="tip">Static dependencies to the CATO3*.DLL files, which contain the DataBrowser and SplitWindow functionality, have been removed in this version of X#.  Applications not using a data browser and/or split window no longer need these .DLLs.  This leads to a smaller memory footprint, faster application startup, and smaller installations.</note>

        Manage a SQL select statement to select a set of rows from an ODBC data source.  The rows can be read, modified, or deleted using the SQLSelect methods.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        Once a SQL table is opened in a DataServer object, it can be manipulated through the methods of the SQLSelect class:
        <code language="X#">
          oCust:= SQLSelect{"SELECT * FROM customer"}
          oCust:Skip(3)
          ? oCust:CustName
          oCust:Delete()
          oCust:Close()
        </code>
        <br/>
        The model for SQL returns rows and columns as a result set, instead of records and fields.  The columns can be considered as exported instance variables of the object.  They can also be accessed through the FieldGet() and FieldPut() methods, with the column identified through a symbol, a string, or a number:
        <code language="X#">
          oCust := SQLSelect{"SELECT * FROM customer"}
          oCust:CustNo := 1234
          ? oCust:CustNo
          oCust:FieldPut(#CustNo, 1234)
          oCust:FieldPut("CustNo", 1234)
          oCust:FieldPut(1, 1234)
          ? oCust:FieldGet(#CustNo)
          ? oCust:FieldGet("CustNo")
          ? oCust:FieldGet(1)
        </code>
        (The columns are, of course, not real exported variables of the SQLSelect class.  See "Objects, Classes, and Methods" in the Programmer's Guide for a discussion of how these "virtual" exported variables are created using the NoIVarGet() and NoIVarPut() methods.)
        <br/>
        Unlike the DBServer class, the SQLSelect class does not position the server on the first row when an object is created.  However, when a method that references the first row is called, it will automatically be positioned on the first row.
        For databases that support positioned operations (such as, WATCOM) using scrollable cursors, the positioning methods (GoTop(), GoBottom(), Skip(), GoTo()) use the driver.  Otherwise, SQLSelect buffers the rows as it moves forward and performs the positioning methods by moving within the buffer (for backwards positioning).  Refer to the SQLConnection:ScrollCsr access for additional information.  To disable this buffering, use the SQLSelect:BufferData() method.
        <br/>
        It is not possible to use the SQLSelect class to create a database table; the table must exist before a server can be opened on it.
        <note type="tip">
          The cursor type and lock mode that is used by a SQLSelect object can be controlled by the following functions.
          Please consult the documentation for the ODBC driver you are using to see the effects of this setting on the performance of your application.

      </summary>
      <remarks>
        A status bar is the shallow bar that appears usually at the bottom of a window to provide status information to the user without taking up much screen "real-estate."  Visual Object's status bar class has methods to present the following kinds of information:
        &#0009;Status messages (permanent or transient)
        &#0009;Time
        &#0009;Keyboard state (NumLock, CapsLock, ScrollLock, and Insert keys)
        &#0009;Virtual memory available
        &#0009;A screen coordinate reading
        The sequence in which you call the various Display… methods determines the left-to-right order in which the corresponding items appear upon the status bar.  Any transient status message overrides the StatusBar:PermanentText status message, but it times out after five seconds.
        <note type="tip">You never create a status bar yourself.  Instead, you ask the window to do it, by calling AppWindow:EnableStatusBar().  Once you pick up the status bar returned by that method, you can customize the status bar by invoking the various Display… methods of status bar.  Note that, except for the time display, the status bar items require you to refresh them.  For example, if you turn on the display of available virtual memory, you must call the StatusBar:RefreshMemoryDisplay() method whenever the application is about to embark on a "memory-hungry" task.  Because you never create status bars, you also never destroy them — the window does that itself.</note>

          This control is dependent on version 6 or greater of the COMCTL32.DLL and WinXP Theams.
          When XP themes are not available, such as when running on Windows 2000 or running the application on XP in "classic" mode, the SysLink control displays the full text assigned to it - any hyperlink references are included as literal text. It is suggested that the programmer should test for XP theme support, see IsThemeEnabled(), to determine what text should be assigned to the SysLink control
          For this reason it is recomended that it is called in this way -
          <code language="X#">
            IF IsThemeEnabled()
            s := "Visit &lt;A HREF="+_chr(34)+;

            ENDIF
          </code>
          The difference between the HyperLink and the SysLink classes is in the way that the text is used.
          In a HyperLink control, ALL of the text is passed as the hyperlink where as in the SysLink control you can mix display text and hyperlink text.

        System menus are used to provide a series of standard operations, such as moving, closing, and resizing windows.  Different GUI conventions dictate what items should be added to the system menu.
        An application window can have a system menu by calling AppWindow:EnableSystemMenu().  Using the Window:MenuCommand() event handler, the system menu can be manipulated in the same way as a menu.
        To access a window's system menu, you must first enable the system menu with a call to AppWindow:EnableSystemMenu().  You can then use the system menu it returns.

    <member name="T:VO.ToolBar">
      <summary>
        Create a toolbar.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        A toolbar provides the user with an alternative way of selecting menu commands.  Although a toolbar looks more like a collection of controls than like a menu, it is constructed and manipulated as a menu rather than as a control.  It is true that the events generated by a menu, a toolbar, and a push button are not fundamentally different: each menu command, toolbar button, or push button has a symbolic name; each type of event calls a named method; each has a description that appears in the status bar ("short help") and a help context that appears when you select context help (Shift+F1).  But, since the toolbar is one object, capable of generating many events, and, since it is attached to the window as a whole (instead of as several push buttons), it resembles a menu more than a regular control.  Also, the standard way of defining and using a toolbar is as an adjunct of its associated menu; this is the structure generated by the Menu Editor.
        <br/>
        Toolbar buttons can be presented with icons, icons plus text captions, or text only.  The border around the buttons offers several different looks, and the gaps between buttons can be adjusted.  If a toolbar is too small to display all its buttons, perhaps because its owner window is too small, it automatically presents scrolling buttons.
        The placement of the toolbar depends, to a certain extent, on its contents.  For example, text-only buttons are long and thin, and are, therefore, better stacked along a vertical edge than along the top or bottom edge.  Icon-only buttons, with no gaps, look very natural along the top edge.  Icon and text buttons, with a small gap, are effective along the bottom edge.
        The ToolBar class also provides CoolBar/Band support, i.e., toolbars with separator bands:
        <br/>
        (This example is from one of the Internet Explorer's flat-style, toolbar bands.)
        <br/>
        A window is assigned a toolbar the same way it is assigned a menu, through an assignment to AppWindow:ToolBar().  Each toolbar button is associated with a menu command and generates the corresponding menu event; therefore, the menu and toolbar assigned to a window must be coordinated.  The most convenient way to manage the toolbar is to associate it with a menu when both are created.  Then, when the menu is assigned to the window, its toolbar is automatically assigned as well.  This automatic approach, which fits the class definition created by the Menu Editor, ensures that toolbar button clicks are associated with the intended menu command event.
        <code language="X#">
          METHOD Init(oWOwner) CLASS MyWindow
          &#0009;...
          SELF:Menu := MyMenu{}
          &#0009;...
          METHOD Init() CLASS MyMenu
          &#0009;...
          &#0009;SELF:ToolBar := ToolBar{}
        </code>
        (This is also the approach used with the accelerator table.  Thus, a "menu" is actually a combination of menu, accelerator table, and toolbar, all coordinated and all used together.)
        <br/>
        It is possible to place a toolbar on any window, even windows that cannot own menus (such as dialog windows and nested subwindows).  In these cases, assigning a menu does not produce a visible menu, but the toolbar is still active.  It is also possible to have a toolbar button associated with a menu command that is not included on any menu, as long as the menu command is registered with Menu:RegisterItem().
        A toolbar takes up room on the window's client area.  Some window types automatically adapt to this spatial conflict, but others require explicit management of space.
        The most common use of a toolbar in business applications is to attach it to a shell window or a data window.  Both of these window types automatically adapt to the toolbar, so no further action is required.  The data window is most likely used as a child window under the shell, or as a nested subwindow; in either case, the data window adapts to the toolbar.
        Placing a toolbar on a subwindow is particularly useful:  it visually associates operations with the data they apply to.  Many data windows may use toolbar buttons like Insert Record, Delete Record, Skip Next, Skip Previous, Go Top, Go Bottom, Seek, Undo, Cut, Copy, and Paste.
        With general top windows, child windows, and dialog windows, the management of space is the responsibility of the developer.  With a toolbar on the window, this is somewhat tricky, especially if the user is allowed to drag the toolbar around: the room available depends both on resizing of the window and placement of the toolbar.  The toolbar has the ToolBar:ClientArea access, which can be called during expose events to determine the shape of the remaining area.
        <br/>
        The action of control events sent by a toolbar attached to a window would seem to be pretty obvious:  clicking on the Print button sends a #Print message to the window.  But what happens if the toolbar is not attached to a child window, but to the shell window?  Or if it is attached to the child window but the method that acts on the message belongs to the shell window?  And what of a toolbar attached to a data window used as a nested subform?
        Toolbars are identical to menus in their action.  Regardless of which window owns the toolbar or menu, the command event is sent first to the window that has focus; if it does not deal with it, it is sent to its owner, and to its owner, until it is handled.  If no window responds to the message, the shell window displays a message in its status bar.
        More precisely, the chain of responses looks like this, given the symbolic name of the toolbar or menu command:
        &#0009;Does the window that has focus have a method with a proper name?  If so, it is called.
        &#0009;<note type="tip">This is not necessarily the window that owns the toolbar or menu.</note>
        &#0009;Check if its owner has a matching method, as well as the owner's owner, and so on.
        &#0009;If no window has a matching method, the message is sent to the MenuCommand() method of the window with focus.  The default implementation has the following logic:  if it is owned by a window (as is a child window or subform), pass the method up to its owner; if it is owned by the application (as is the top or shell window), check if there is a window class with that name, and if so instantiate it; if not, display the message.  The MenuCommand() method can, of course, be replaced with different logic (for example, the traditional CASE statement often used in low-level Windows programming).
        Thus, there are two chains of escalation:  first, the system looks for matching method names up the ownership chain; then it escalates through the MenuCommand() methods up the ownership chain.  If nobody reacts to the method, as a last resort, the window instantiation is tried; otherwise, it fails.
        This means that a toolbar can be placed on the shell window, on a child window, or even on a nested subwindow: it is active in any case, and the message is sent to all the windows and propagated up the ownership chain.  Remember that only one menu is visible at any time, and a child window with a menu replaces the menu of its shell; but toolbars are different, they can be visible on any type of window.
        The window instantiation trick means that if we design a window in the Window Editor, all we have to do to open it is to give its name to a menu or toolbar item that is owned by some visible window.
        <br/>
        Note that there is a potential for confusing the end user with commands that could refer to different windows.  (This problem is not confined to toolbars; it applies to menus as well.)  Consider an order window, with information about an order and a nested subwindow (in browse view) that contains the order's line items.  If a menu contains a Delete command, what does this refer to?  Does it delete an order, an order and all its line items, or only a line item?
        Technically, the issue is clear:  the command is sent to the lowest level window that has focus, so if the user is located on the line item subwindow, that window gets the command first.  If it does not respond to it, the order window and later the shell window gets the command.
        However, from the user's viewpoint, this behavior is not obvious.  The problem lies in the caption of the menu command or toolbar button: "Delete" is not very clear.  Since the user may not be aware that the line item table is a subwindow (it looks just like a table on a window) getting different effects of Delete (depending on where the cursor is) can be confusing.
        It is, therefore, recommended that menu commands and toolbar buttons be labeled explicitly and clearly, for example as "Delete Order" and "Delete Item."  Even if higher-level logic disables commands depending on cursor location and data (for example, Delete Order may be dimmed as long as there are still unshipped line items), captions should still be clear.

        A top-level application window is the main window of an application; it has no owner windows.  As with other application windows, a top application window can have icons, captions, resizeable borders, menus, and system menus.  An application can have more than one top application window.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        This example creates a top application window with the caption "TopAppWindow":

      <remarks>
        There are two types of vertical scroll bars in X#: regular (created with CLASS VerticalScrollBar) and window (created with the AppWindow:EnableVerticalScroll() method).  Both types have an owner window and can be manipulated using Window:VerticalScroll().  However, a window vertical scroll bar differs in that it automatically appears aligned along the right side of its owner window's canvas area and also resizes itself according to the size of its owner window.
        A vertical scroll bar allows the user to update a short integer numeric value by either moving the thumb position, clicking on the button at either end of the scroll bar to change the number by the designated ScrollBar:UnitSize, or by clicking in the interior of the scroll bar to change the number by the designated ScrollBar:BlockSize.  The minimum and maximum allowable numeric values are indicated by the Min and Max values for the Range object associated with the scroll bar.  The ScrollBar:Value access indicates the currently selected numeric value.  A scroll bar may be bound to a numeric field in a server.
        <note type="tip">By default, Window:VerticalScroll() updates the thumb position in the scroll bar; if desired, you can change this by using your own implementation of this handler.</note>
        <br/>
        In Windows, vertical scroll bars are equivalent to a scroll bar with the SBS_VERT style.  These are normally specified in the resource entity like this:

        &#0009;Event handler methods of the Window class are the system's default event handlers.  By overriding these in subclasses, you change the behavior of your derived window from the default behavior provided by the Window class.

        The Create() method is called after the ActiveXControl object is instantiated.  Note that the both methods are called from the ActiveX container application: they should never be called directly from your code.
        Inside Create(), you should:
        1.&#0009;Instantiate a control or window object representing the user interface of the ActiveX control.  This object should be assigned to OCXWindow.
        2.&#0009;Instantiate an object representing the automation interface of the ActiveX control and assign it to AutoServer.
        3.&#0009;Instantiate an object representing the event interface of the ActiveX control and assign it to Events — this step is optional.

      <remarks>
        This method immediately frees resources for AppWindow objects created explicitly in your application.  AppWindow:Destroy() also takes care of resources allocated to derived classes and deallocates them in the necessary order (e.g., child windows are destroyed before the parent window; dialog windows and MDI shell windows are also looked after).

      <remarks>
        A window that is registered as an OLE drop target using AppWindow:EnableOLEDropTarget() can handle OLE drag and drop events and create new OLE objects in response to such events.  In the associated handlers, an OLEDragEvent object is passed as a parameter that can be used to create a new OLE object by calling OLEObject:CreateFromOLEDragEvent().
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following code enables a data window as a drop target and creates a new OLE object inside its OLEDrop handler.  It also checks the name of the OLE object to allow only WordPad documents:

        Constant&#0009;Description<br/>
        EXECNORMAL&#0009;Tells the system to continue to execute the application until either the user closes it (by selecting the Close menu command or using the standard Windows accelerator Alt+F4) or the application decides to close by deliberately invoking the App:Quit() method. When the application terminates, the thread of control exits from App:Exec() to the next statement in your code.  This is the default.<br/>
        EXECWHILEEVENT&#0009;Tells the system to continue to execute the application only while there are still events queued.  Once the system has dispatched the last event in the queue, the thread of control exits from App:Exec(). This gives you the opportunity to do some processing and then start another event loop by invoking App:Exec() again.  You should use this mechanism when you want to do some background processing while the application is idle.
      </param>
      <returns>
        A value of 0 indicates normal termination (no errors).  A non-zero value indicates abnormal termination.
      </returns>
      <remarks>
        Normally, the event handling loop for the application continues looping until there are no more EventContext objects.  It can also terminate upon calling App:Quit().
        <note type="tip">Make sure that you show at least one window object before calling App:Exec().</note>

        <br/>
        You should create and show cursors (if needed) in this event handler method.
        Any subclass with its own Activate() and Deactivate() event handlers should always call its owner's handlers.  This ensures that the caption bars get highlighted or dimmed accordingly.

      <returns>
        A numeric value representing the event handler to handle the event.
      </returns>
      <remarks>
        Controls receive events from the user and the system all of the time.  Each control receives only the events that are relevant to it.  For each event that is generated, two things happen:
        1.&#0009;The event is converted to a particular Event object (an ExposeEvent or a MouseEvent, for example) according to the action that triggered the event.
        2.&#0009;The appropriate event handler is called, and this typed Event object is passed to it.
        <note type="tip">
          If you want to set a specific return value for the underlying window procedure, you have to change the EventReturnValue variable for the control object.
          If you want to handle other events (for example, timer events), you need to write your own Dispatch() method.
          The following guidelines should be followed when writing a customized Dispatch() method:
          1.&#0009;Subclass an event type appropriate to the type of operation for which it is being used.
          2.&#0009;Add an event handler function to your derived object.  (This event handler should be called with the event when the event is received.)
          3.&#0009;In general, the implementation of this event handler should call Default().  This keeps the same behavior as the base class, but it also allows other classes to provide useful event handlers for your new type of event, allowing you to provide a framework for other classes to use.
          The base class Dispatch() method should be called in those cases where the received event is not handled by the customized dispatcher.  For example:
          <code language="X#">RETURN SUPER:Dispatch(&lt;oEvent&gt;)</code>

      <summary>
        Enable a control that was previously disabled.

      <remarks>
        Enabling a control allows it to generate events and to send the events to its owner window when the user manipulates the control.  The dimming of disabled controls is removed, and the control is restored to its normal appearance.
        By default, controls are enabled until disabled, so there is no need to call this Enable() method unless Control:Disable() was previously called.

        &#0009;Increases in size
        &#0009;Is being restored after being iconized
        The control should retain enough information to redraw the screen as it was (or as it should be).
        <br/>
        An ExposeEvent is also triggered by calling Repaint() or Update(); you should not call Repaint() or Update() during the Expose().

        The default behavior for this event handler is to update the thumb position; this can be changed using your own implementation of the handler.  This event handler only works for HorizontalScrollBar and WindowHorizontalScrollBar objects.  If the application has vertical scroll bars, use a WindowVerticalScrollBar event handler.

      <remarks>
        Controls are created in one of two ways: dynamically or from a compiled dialog resource.  Dynamic creation, which requires that size and position be specified as instantiation parameters, can be used on any type of window.  A compiled dialog resource (which specifies both size and location of the control) can be used only with data windows and dialog windows.
        Additionally, the default state when a control is created depends on the way you placed the control:
        &#0009;With dynamic creation, the control remains invisible until you invoke Control:Show().
        &#0009;This allows the program to set up the control correctly (with the correct size, position, and any other parameters), while avoiding the "visual noise" of changing controls.
        &#0009;With resource-bound instantiation, the control is automatically shown, without requiring a call to Control:Show().

      <remarks>
        Control:LinkDF() should ordinarily not be called directly by the application.  It is called by the DataWindow:Use() method; Use() connects an entire client to an entire server. You can use Control:LinkDF() to link a control to a data field explicitly, perhaps if the control's name doesn't match the data field's name so the automatic linkage of the Use() method doesn't work.
        It is even possible to use Control:LinkDF() to link individual controls to different servers; however, this is not recommended, because none of the automatic behavior of the data window and none of its cooperation with the data server applies to more than one server.  Notifications are not to be received for servers other than the main server that the window is registered with, and actions such as DataWindow:Delete() and DataWindow:Append() apply to the main server.  To link a window to more than one database, use the techniques described in the "GUI Classes" chapter of the Programmer's Guide.

        When column focus is changed (i.e., the user moves from one column to another), typically there will be two events generated, thus ColumnFocusChange() will be called twice.  The first event will be for the previous column losing focus and the second event will be for the new column gaining focus.  You can trap either event by checking the value of &lt;lHasFocus&gt;.

        </list>
        This Notify() method is at the heart of the automatic notification among linked browsers and servers, allowing any window to make a change to a field value or initiate a movement and also ensuring that all client windows reflect the change.  Any class that is registered as a client of a server must respond intelligently to the message.
        As always with defined constants, you should never rely on the actual values of the constants — they do not necessarily stay the same.  However, the constants maintain their order:
        Constant&#0009;Value Level
        NOTIFYFIELDCHANGE&#0009;Lowest
        NOTIFYCLOSE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYCOMPLETION&#0009;...
        NOTIFYINTENTTOMOVE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYRECORDCHANGE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYGOBOTTOM&#0009;...
        NOTIFYGOTOP&#0009;...
        NOTIFYDELETE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYAPPEND&#0009;...
        NOTIFYFILECHANGE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYRELATIONCHANGE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYCLEARRELATION&#0009;Highest
        Thus, you can reliably write:
        <code language="X#">
          IF    kNotifyName &gt; NOTIFYINTENTTOMOVE;
          &#0009;.AND. kNotifyName &lt; NOTIFYFILECHANGE

        Paste the current contents of the clipboard into the current data browser cell.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        How clipboard data is pasted into the data browser depends on the following:
        &#0009;The current selection
        <br/>
        &#0009;The current selection can be a few characters in a cell, an entire cell's contents, several cells, several records, or nothing at all.
        <br/>
        &#0009;If a few characters or an entire cell is selected, the selected characters are overwritten with the pasted data.  Note that in this case, the standard tab-separated format accepted by spreadsheet and word processor products is used, as long as the shape of the selection matches.
        <br/>
        &#0009;If nothing is selected, the clipboard data is inserted into the current cell (i.e., the one containing the cursor).  Note that the data is inserted before the cursor.
        <br/>
        &#0009;<note type="tip">Paste() is not allowed if more than one record is selected.</note>
        <br/>
        &#0009;The Insert key
        &#0009;Note that this method changes the fields to which this data browser's cells are linked and, therefore, the changes are subject to validation.  The operation leaves the cells blank, but required fields or other validation rules can mark the record as invalid.
        The operation performed by this method is the same action as is normally performed in standard GUI applications by the Edit Paste menu command (note that under Windows, this menu command is typically linked to the Ctrl+V and/or Shift+Insert accelerators).  This standard behavior is automatically provided by X# and, therefore, there is no need to provide a special method for this (in fact, the accelerators work even if there is no menu command).

        This method is used to reduce "visual noise" during a multi-record update of the data browser from its data server.  For example, when reading a full screen of data, the appearance of the window is more pleasing if the screen updates occur all together.  When the updating is complete, use the DataBrowser:RestoreUpdate() method to refresh the display and reactivate standard behavior.

      <remarks>
        DataColumn:LinkDF() should ordinarily not be called directly by the application. It is called by DataBrowser:Use(); Use() connects an entire client to an entire server.  You can use DataColumn:LinkDF() to link a column to a data field explicitly, perhaps if the column's name doesn't match the data field's name so the automatic linkage of DataBrowser:Use() doesn't work.
        It is even possible to use DataColumn:LinkDF() to link individual columns to different servers; however, this is not recommended, because none of the automatic behavior of the data window and none of its cooperation with the data server applies to more than one server.  Notifications will not be received for servers other than the main server that the window is registered with, and actions such as DataWindow:Delete() and DataWindow:Append() apply to the main server.  To link a window to more than one database, use the techniques described in the "GUI Classes" chapter of the Programmer's Guide.

            <description>The record position of the server has changed.   All clients are notified after any movement, so they can refresh their displays from the server.  A data list view needs to update its display intelligently, depending on how far the move was.   &lt;uDescription&gt; might indicate the length of the move (the number of records).  The data list view can use this information for display optimization, but cannot rely on its availability.  </description>

        This Notify() method is at the heart of the automatic notification among linked browsers and servers, allowing any window to make a change to a field value or initiate a movement and also ensuring that all client windows reflect the change.  Any class that is registered as a client of a server must respond intelligently to the message.
        As always with defined constants, you should never rely on the actual values of the constants -- they do not necessarily stay the same.  However, the constants maintain their order:
        Constant&#0009;Value Level
        NOTIFYFIELDCHANGE&#0009;Lowest
        NOTIFYCLOSE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYCOMPLETION&#0009;...
        NOTIFYINTENTTOMOVE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYRECORDCHANGE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYGOBOTTOM&#0009;...
        NOTIFYGOTOP&#0009;...
        NOTIFYDELETE&#0009;...

        NOTIFYRELATIONCHANGE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYCLEARRELATION&#0009;Highest

        TRUE if the operation was successful; FALSE if not. (How can closing down a server be unsuccessful?  If you are accessing a database over a network, and the network goes down before the server is closed, the DataServer:Close() operation may be the first one to fail, but it is still important to respond to this failure since it may indicate that database changes are not committed.)

      <remarks>
        DataServer:Commit() can fail for many reasons, ranging from a lack of capability in the server to lock conflicts and technical problems, such as network crashes.  Use the DataServer:Status property to determine the exact cause of the failure.
        The exact implications of this action depend on the type of the data server.  With some database management systems, the method commits all servers using the same connection; with others, it commits only this server; and with yet others, the method does nothing.  In addition, some SQL servers have other implications of a commit operation (they can close cursors, for example).

        This method is at the heart of the automatic notification among linked windows and servers.  When certain actions are performed on a data server, the methods that perform those actions automatically call their Notify() method upon completion of the action.  The data server then sends a broadcast Notify message to all of its clients to notify them of the action.
        This ensures that all clients (for example, data windows or data browsers) remain in sync with their underlying servers and reflect the change (for example, update a field value or add a new record).
        Any class that is registered as a client of a server must respond intelligently to these Notify messages.
        In some cases, the notification may come from another object rather than from a method of the same server object. For example, in the DBServer subclass, relations cause notifications to be sent among servers.
        As always with defined constants, you should never rely on the actual values of the constants — they will not necessarily stay the same.  However, the constants do maintain their order:

        This method checks for pending updates to the current record by comparing the values that were read to the record when the server was initially positioned on the record with the current values in the corresponding database record.
        If the values match, it signifies that no other user has modified the data since the user started working on it, and, therefore, that it is safe to lock the record and let the user continue with an update transaction.  (Note that when locked, other users can still make read-only reference to the record.)
        If the values do not match, somebody else has changed the record, and the user should refresh the values from disk and  restart the transaction.  The application has to decide what to do about values that are different.  Note that DataServer:Status can be used to determine the reason for the failure.
        This method is used for optimistic concurrency control.  See "Concurrency Control" in the Programmer's Guide for more information.)

        This method can fail for many reasons, from a lack of capability in the server to lock conflicts to technical problems such as network crashes.  Use DataServer:Status to determine the exact cause of the failure.
        Note that not all servers support this operation, including the standard Xbase DBServer.  If the server does support it, the exact implications of a rollback vary with the server.  With some database management systems, the method rolls back all servers using the same connection; with others, it rolls back only this server.  In addition, some SQL servers have other implications of a rollback operation (they can close cursors, for example).

        This method is useful, for example, when the server is moving through the database and the server is ultimately restored to its original position.  Therefore, there is no reason to notify the clients of the server of a change in position within the database.

        The "cancel" operation is very clear and easily understood and might be profitably used on data windows when they are created as MDI children (unconventional or not).
        Note that a user might be unclear on exactly what transactions are discarded.  For example, if several records have been modified, the default implementation of DataWindow:Cancel() discards changes only to the current record.  You might want to label the button or menu command something else or provide a more comprehensive implementation.
        <note type="tip">DataWindow:Cancel() disconnects itself from the data server using DataServer:UnregisterClient() and tells the server that it can close itself if it has no other registered clients.  Explicitly forcing the server to close from a window is not recommended, since this can create future problems.  Modifications to the application can attach other clients to the server, and any one window should not disable other windows.</note>

        You should also note that there is no guarantee that changes which have not been committed can be rolled back.  The rollback capabilities depend on the particular data server implementation (for example, SQLSelect can usually do it — depending on the particular SQL database in use — but DBServer cannot).  For details, please refer to the documentation on the specific server you intend to use.

        When executed successfully, the data server from which the record was deleted sends a NotifyDelete message to all of its clients, including this data window.
        With some servers (notably DBServer), a deleted record is not removed from the server but is simply marked as deleted.  Marked records are removed only when the file is packed, and until such time can be recalled.  (With DBServer, the current setting of the SetDeleted() function affects whether deleted records are visible.)  Changes that have been made to fields are recorded in the record before it is deleted; if the field is subsequently recalled, it correctly reflects any changes made before the delete operation.
        <note type="tip">DataWindow:Delete() advances to the next record (if SetDeleted() is TRUE) after the deletion takes place, unlike DBServer:Delete() which does not.</note>
        DataWindow:Delete() does not check validation status before allowing a delete operation.  If the window contains invalid data, it is discarded and the delete operation is completed.  If you would prefer to validate before deletion, use DataWindow:DeleteValidated().

        When executed successfully, the data server from which the record was deleted sends a NotifyDelete message to all of its clients, including this data window.
        This method checks validation status before allowing a delete operation.  If the window contains invalid data, the user is asked if the data should be discarded or corrected before the delete operation is continued.  If this behavior is not desired (perhaps because the application does not use recall or the window is to be used only with servers that do not support recall of deleted records), use DataWindow:Delete().
        With some servers (notably DBServer), a deleted record is not removed from the server but is simply marked as deleted.  Marked records are removed only when the file is packed, and until such time can be recalled.  (With DBServer, the current setting of the SetDeleted() function affects whether deleted records are visible.)  Changes that have been made to fields are recorded in the record before it is deleted; if the field is subsequently recalled, it correctly reflects any changes made before the delete operation.

        DataWindow:GoBottom() can fail for many reasons, from a lack of capability in the server to lock conflicts to technical problems, such as network crashes.  Use the DataServer:Status property to determine the exact cause of the failure.

      <summary>
        Provide a method that is invoked when the user requests help from the application using one of the available context-sensitive help mechanisms.
        Important!  This is a callback method used by X#.  Normally, it should not be called in your application code.
      </summary>

      <param name="oHelpRequestEvent">The HelpRequestEvent object that describes which item help is being requested for.</param>
      <remarks>
        This event handler is invoked only if the help mechanism has been enabled for the current data window (or one of its owners).  The help mechanism is enabled by assigning a HelpDisplay object to the windows HelpDisplay property.
        The default implementation of this event handler is to display the help topic that is associated with the control, menu command, or window region with focus when the HelpRequestEvent was generated.  This is accomplished using HelpDisplay:Show(&lt;cKeyword&gt;), where &lt;cKeyword&gt; is either a HyperLabel:HelpContext property or a default keyword generated by this event handler in cases where a hyperlabel is not available.
        If there is no hyperlabel for an item, the keyword generated is as follows:
        &#0009;A HELPCONTROL request generates the keyword Control_xxxx, where xxxx is the numeric ID of the control, in decimal.  For example, an OK push button might generate the keyword Control_101.
        &#0009;A HELPMENU request generates the keyword Menu_xxxx, where xxxx is the "cleaned" text of the menu command.  The cleaned text has all leading and trailing spaces and the ampersand character (&amp;) removed.  In addition, all sequences of spaces are replaced by a single underscore, and the string is truncated at the first tab character.
        <br/>
        &#0009;For example, the keyword generated for the menu command:
        &#0009;Save &amp;As\tF3
        &#0009;is
        &#0009;Menu_Save_As
        &#0009;A HELPWINDOW request generates one of the keywords listed in the table below, depending on the window region that has focus.
        Keyword&#0009;Window Region
        Window_Border&#0009;Border
        Window_Caption&#0009;Title bar
        Window_MaxBox&#0009;Maximize button
        Window_MinBox&#0009;Minimize button
        Window_SysMenuBox&#0009;System menu button
        Window_Unknown&#0009;Any area of the window not explicitly identified in this table
        Window_WindowCanvas&#0009;Canvas area
        <br/>
        &#0009;<note type="tip">If the Window_Unknown keyword is generated, the default behavior of HelpRequest() is to display the Contents topic as defined in the HelpDisplay (that is, HelpDisplay:Show("HelpIndex")).</note>
        <br/>
        &#0009;If a HELPWINDOW request is received, while DataWindow:HelpContext is defined, DataWindow:HelpRequest() uses the HelpContext property, regardless of the window region that has focus.
        &#0009;Refer to the "GUI Classes" chapter in the Programmer's Guide for more information on programming an online help system for your application.

        This method checks the validation status of the window.  If the data is valid and is correctly downloaded to the data server, it forces a commitment to the server and then closes the window.
        The "OK" operation is very clear and easily understood and might be profitably used on data windows used as MDI children (unconventional or not).
        Note that a user might be confused about exactly what information is accepted (for example, in a complex data window with nested windows).  If there is any uncertainty, you might consider labeling a button or menu command with something more explicit.
        <note type="tip">DataWindow:OK() disconnects itself from the data server using DataServer:UnregisterClient() and tells the server that it can close itself if it has no other registered clients.  Explicitly forcing the server to close from a window is not recommended, since this can create future problems.  Modifications to the application can attach other clients to the server, and any one window should not disable other windows.</note>

    <member name="M:VO.DataWindow.PreValidate">
      <summary>
        Called after any status change in this data window to allow controls and menu commands to be enabled/disabled based on the current validation status.
        Important!  This is a callback method used by X#.  Normally, it should not be called in your application code.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        This method provides some of the functionality of the WHEN clause in classical Xbase @...SAY...GET statements.  However, since the GUI approach does not enforce a rigid sequence of data entry but allows the user to move from control to control at random, the logic of enabling and disabling controls must be different.
        Instead of checking a condition when focus switches into the control (this is too late, a user with a mouse is already on the new control), the system must keep checking on every significant event.
        DataWindow:Prevalidate() provides some automatic handling of this type of validation (through DataWindow:RegisterConditionalControls()), but it also allows you to insert custom logic by overriding the method.
        The standard action in DataWindow:Prevalidate() is to call DataWindow:EnableConditionalControls(); if problems exist, it calls DataWindow:DisableConditionalControls().  DataWindow:Prevalidate() is called after the application of the standard validation, allowing the user to replace the default handling, upon success or failure of validation.

      </returns>
      <remarks>
        When a user tries to close an application by selecting the Close menu command from a system menu (or by using another method to end the session), the system calls each data window's QueryClose() event handler.

      </summary>

      <param name="oControl">The control to be registered.</param>
      <remarks>
        Conditional controls allow the developer to register several controls as subject to validation.  This means that when the window fails validation, these controls are automatically disabled; when the window's status is OK, they are automatically enabled again.
        Controls that have been registered are automatically enabled or disabled — depending on validation status — by DataWindow:Prevalidate(), which is called on any status change in the window.
        In a practical data entry window, all the buttons would be registered and conditionally disabled — SkipNext, SkipPrevious, GoTop, GoBottom, Insert, Delete, OK — except for Cancel, which discards the invalid changes and hence should always be available.

        TRUE if operation was successful; otherwise, FALSE.  Skip() can fail for several different reasons.  It can fail validation, there may not be that many records to move, the write that precedes the move can fail because of lock conflicts with other users that control the server, or the server can have become unavailable due to technical problems.  Use DataWindow:Status to determine the reason for the failure.
      </returns>
      <remarks>
        This method is subject to validation (i.e., if the data in the window fails validation, the movement is refused).
        The method does not explicitly refresh the contents of the window after the move; this is done automatically by the NotifyRecordChange message that follows.
        Because it takes a numeric argument, the Skip() method is rarely connected directly with a push button or menu command:  for simple movements, use the SkipNext() and SkipPrevious() methods.  Skip() provides a lot of flexibility but is usually called from code, in methods of the data window.

        OLEDataWindow:UpdateActiveObject() calls the UpdateTools() method of any currently activated OLE object that the OLE data window contains.  It first determines which OLE object control is in-place active, and then replaces the X# container application's toolbars with the OLE server's toolbars.  In response to a resizing of the container application, this method causes the OLE object server to rearrange its toolbars.

        TRUE if the connection was successful; otherwise, FALSE.  The operation fails under the following conditions:  if the window has controls and columns but none matches the names of the fields of the server and, of course, if there is a technical problem with the server.
      </returns>
      <remarks>
        The Use() method connects controls and browser columns with fields of the data server based on matching names.  Any control that does not have an explicitly provided field specification and hyperlabel inherits the field specification and hyperlabel from its data server field.
        If the window does not have any controls or columns, the Use() method automatically creates a layout with controls or columns for all the fields in the server.  A layout is created for each view — data window and browse — only when it is needed.
        Use() also registers the window as a client of the server with the DataServer:RegisterClient() method.

        TRUE if all fields in the current record are valid; otherwise, FALSE.
      </returns>
      <remarks>
        No default version of this method exists in the data window class.  If a record-level validation method is provided, it should return a logical value indicating if the window is valid overall.  If it returns FALSE, the method should set the window's Status property to a HyperLabel object with at least an appropriate description and possibly a help context tag, as well.
        ValidateRecord() can be used to perform cross-field validations, such as "the bonus can be no greater than half the salary and no greater than 10,000 for grades 6 and lower" and "tax filing information must be filled in if state is NY".  While it is certainly possible to specify such validation rules for individual controls, and keep the controls independent of one another.  This improves the reusability of code, making a control and its field specification usable regardless of what else is on the window.

      <remarks>
        The DBFileSpec:Create() method is useful for generating a new DBF file given a file specification and path.  The DBCreate() function is also useful to do the same thing, however this approach is more efficient.
        Note that the DBServer class does not contain a Create() method: instantiating a DBServer requires that the file exists already, so one cannot be created. The CopyDB() and CopyStructure() methods of the DBServer class often provide an easier way of copying the structure, completely or partially, of an existing file.
        Note that the method does not open the file.

        DBServer:BLOBDirectImport() provides a mechanism for copying the contents of a file into a BLOB file.
        DBServer:BLOBDirectImport() is used in conjunction with DBServer:BLOBDirectExport() to transfer data back and forth between external files and BLOB files.  You can use DBServer:BLOBDirectImport() with a variety of file types, including graphics images, word processor files, and printer fonts.  These two methods are excellent for creating databases of documents, graphics, sounds, and so on.
        Important!  After importing a file with DBServer:BLOBDirectImport(), nNewPointer, the return value, is the only way to access the data from the BLOB file.  It is up to you, the developer, to provide permanent storage for this reference (see example below)
        <note type="tip">DBServer:FieldInfo(DBS_BLOB_TYPE, &lt;nFieldPos&gt;) will return "C" (string) for any memo field created using DBServer:BLOBDirectImport().</note>

        This example imports a .BMP file to be part of an array of startup data.  The data, stored in the root area of the BLOB file, could then be used to display the application's startup screen:

      <remarks>
        DBServer:BLOBRootPut() allows the storage of one — and only one — piece of data to a BLOB file's root area (there is no size limitation on this one piece of data).  After storing the new data, DBServer:BLOBRootPut() releases the space associated with any data previously stored in the BLOB file's root area.
        <note type="tip">Because the root data does not reference a particular record in the data server, it is not affected by DBServer:RLock(), nor is it subject to the DataServer:ConcurrencyControl settings.  Therefore, if the data server is opened in shared mode, you should use DBServer:BLOBRootLock() before calling DBServer:BLOBRootGet().</note>

      </param>
      <returns>
        TRUE if successful; otherwise, FALSE.  Note that after a FALSE indication of a scoped operation, some records can have been deleted: the operation can have failed halfway through because of lock conflicts or technical problems.
      </returns>
      <remarks>
        If called with a scope or if a server scope is active, Delete() sends a NotifyIntentToMove message before the operation, and a NotifyFileChange upon completion (regardless of the number of records actually deleted).  If no scope is used and Delete() applies to the current record only, it sends a NotifyRecordChange message, if successful.  If a scope is specified, on successful completion, the current record will be the last file record and DBServer:EOF will be TRUE.
        Important!  Since the scope is persistent, a scope left around from processing a method like CopyDB() or Average() could cause Delete() to process too many records.  Remember to reset a scope after it has been used.
        Even though the record is marked for deletion, it remains in the file and can be recalled.  (The current setting of the SetDeleted() function affects whether deleted records are visible.)  If changes have been made to fields, the changes are recorded in the record before it is flagged as deleted; thus, if the field is recalled, it correctly reflects any changes made before the delete operation.
        <note type="tip">DBServer:Delete() does not advance to the next record after the deletion takes place, unlike DataWindow:Delete() which does (if SetDeleted() is TRUE).</note>

      <param name="symMethod">The symbolic name of the method that originated the error.</param>
      <remarks>
        All methods of the DBServer trap serious errors with a recover statement and send them to this method.  Ordinary failures, such as locking conflicts or record-not-found, do not raise error conditions; they are simply indicated through failure return values.
        The standard Error() handling method fills in some more information about the errors and about the DBServer object that originates the error, sets the status value for the server object, and passes the problem to its client, if there is one, in its standard Error() handling method.  If there is no client who wants to deal with the problem, the method passes it up the call stack by issuing a BREAK with the same Error object.
        <note type="tip">If an error comes in while one is being handled, the Error() method immediately breaks.</note>
      </remarks>

        DBServer:FieldInfo() retrieves information about the state of a field (column).
        The field information that is available is defined by the RDD.  In the DBF model, this is limited to the information stored in the DBF file structure (that is, name, length, number of decimals, and data type) plus the field alias that can be changed at runtime.
        To support RDDs for other database models (such as dictionary based databases) that store more information about each field or column, the X# RDD API has been enhanced.  The DBServer:FieldInfo() method is designed to allow for additional &lt;kInfoType&gt; values that can be defined by third-party RDD developers.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following examples use DBServer:FieldInfo() to retrieve field information:
        <code language="X#">
          METHOD DBOutStruct() CLASS Customer
          &#0009;LOCAL aStruct AS ARRAY
          &#0009;LOCAL wFcount AS DWORD
          &#0009;LOCAL i       AS DWORD
          &#0009;aStruct := {}
          &#0009;wFcount := FCount()
          &#0009;FOR i := 1 UPTO wFcount
          &#0009;&#0009;AAdd(aStruct,;
          &#0009;&#0009;&#0009;{SELF:FieldInfo(DBS_NAME, i),;
          &#0009;&#0009;&#0009;SELF:FieldInfo(DBS_TYPE, i),;
          &#0009;&#0009;&#0009;SELF:FieldInfo(DBS_LEN, i),;
          &#0009;&#0009;&#0009;SELF:FieldInfo(DBS_DEC, i)})
          &#0009;NEXT
          &#0009;RETURN aStruct
        </code>
        The next example illustrates using the third parameter to assign an alias to a field name:

        The key expression actually belongs to an order and not to an index file.  When using single-order indexes, or when the order name uniquely identifies an order, requesting key information for an index with IndexKey() works.  But this practice is not recommended, since the request may not work when a different driver is used.

        If a FileSpec object is specified, its file name component is used as the file to open.  It can also contain a full path with drive and directories, or just a file name.<br/>
        With either type of parameter, if only a file name is specified, the DBServer works the same way as the USE command or the DBUseArea() function with regard to default path — it is subject to SET PATH and SET DEFAULT, for example.  The extension DBF is assumed by default.<br/>

      <returns>
        TRUE if successful; otherwise, FALSE.  If it fails, some records may remain locked; this allows the program to try again, incrementally locking more and more records as other applications free them.  If the application gives up on the attempt, the locks should be explicitly released.

      <example>
        A selective relation is set up between customer and order servers.  The application operates under "cursor stability" mode, which means that the currently active record remains locked and hence protected from outside influence.  When a customer record is locked, all the orders that correspond to that customer are also locked:

        This method is at the heart of the automatic notification among linked windows and servers.  When certain actions are performed on a data server, the methods that perform those actions automatically call their Notify() method upon completion of the action.  The data server then sends a broadcast Notify message to all of its clients to notify them of the action.
        This ensures that all clients (for example, data windows or data browsers) remain in sync with their underlying servers and reflect the change (for example, update a field value or add a new record).
        Any class that is registered as a client of a server must respond intelligently to these Notify messages.
        In some cases, the notification may come from another object rather than from a method of the same server object.
        Relations among servers, for example, cause file change notifications to be sent from the parent to the child server.
        As always with defined constants, you should never rely on the actual values of the constants — they will not necessarily stay the same.  However, the constants do maintain their order:

      <example>
        This example uses DBOI_NAME to save the current controlling order.  After changing to a new controlling order, it uses the saved value to restore the original order:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBCust := Customer{}
          oDBCust:SetIndex("name")
          oDBCust:SetIndex("serial")
          cOrder := oDBCust:OrderInfo(DBOI_NAME)&#0009;&#0009;// name
          oDBCust:SetOrder("serial")
          ? oDBCust:OrderInfo(DBOI_NAME)&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// serial
          oDBCust:SetOrder(cOrder)
          ? oDBCust:OrderInfo(DBOI_NAME)&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// name
        </code>
        This example returns the default index file extension (using DBOI_INDEXEXT) for two different data servers:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBSales := Sales{}
          oDBCust := Customer{}
          ? oDBSales:OrderInfo(DBOI_INDEXEXT)&#0009;    &#0009;// .CDX
          ? oDBCust:OrderInfo(DBOI_INDEXEXT)     &#0009;&#0009;// .NTX
        </code>
        In this example, DBServer:OrderInfo(DBOI_INDEXEXT) checks for the existence of the CUSTOMER index file independent of the RDD associated with the data server:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBCust := Customer{}
          IF !File("customer" + oDBCust:OrderInfo(DBOI_INDEXEXT))
          &#0009;oDBCust:CreateIndex("customer", "oDBCust:CustName")
          ENDIF
        </code>
        This example accesses the key expression of several orders from the same index file:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBCust := Customer{}
          oDBCust:SetOrder("serial")
          ? oDBCust:OrderInfo(DBOI_EXPRESSION,, "name")
          &#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// Result: key expression for name order
          ? oDBCust:OrderInfo(DBOI_EXPRESSION,, "serial")
          &#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// Result: key expression for serial order
        </code>
        In this example, ALL_CUST.MDX contains three orders named CUACCT, CUNAME, CUZIP.  The DBOI_INDEXNAME constant is used to display the name of the index file using one of its orders:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBCust := Customer{}
          oDBCust:SetIndex("all_cust")
          ? oDBCust:OrderInfo(DBOI_INDEXNAME,, "cuname")
          &#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// Returns: all_cust
        </code>
        The following example searches for CUNAME in the order list:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBCust := Customer{}
          oDBCust:SetIndex("cuacct")
          oDBCust:SetIndex("cuname")
          oDBCust:SetIndex("cuzip")
          ? oDBCust:OrderInfo(DBOI_NUMBER,, "cuname")  // 2
        </code>
        This example retrieves the "for condition" from an order:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBCust := Customer{}
          oDBCust:SetOrderCondition("oDBCust:Acct &gt; 'AZZZZZ'")
          oDBCust:CreateIndex("customer", "oDBCust:Acct")
          oDBCust:OrderInfo(DBOI_CONDITION,, "customer")
          &#0009;&#0009;&#0009;&#0009;// Returns: oDBCust:Acct &gt; 'AZZZZZ'
        </code>

      </returns>
      <remarks>
        A custom built order is one that is not automatically maintained by the DBFCDX driver.  You can determine if an order is custom built using DBServer:OrderInfo(DBOI_CUSTOM, ...).  When you create such an order, it is initially empty.
        You must manually add and delete keys using DBServer:OrderKeyAdd() and DBServer:OrderKeyDel().
        DBServer:OrderKeyAdd() evaluates the key expression (or &lt;uKeyValue&gt;, if specified), then adds the key for the current record to the order.  If the order has a for condition, the key will be added only if that condition is met, and then, only if it falls within the current scoping range.
        <note type="tip">RDDs may allow you to add several keys for the same record with consecutive calls to DBServer:OrderKeyAdd().</note>
        DBServer:OrderKeyAdd() will fail if:
        &#0009;The record pointer is positioned on an invalid record (i.e., at DBServer:EOF)
        &#0009;The specified order is not custom built
        &#0009;The specified order does not exist
        &#0009;No order was specified and there is no controlling order
        <note type="tip">
          From the standard RDDs only the DBFCDX RDD supports Custom Indexes. This RDD does NOT support the use of the &lt;uKeyValue&gt; parameter. It always uses the Key Expression to calculate the Key Values to insert.
        </note>
      </remarks>
      <example>
        This example creates a custom index and adds every fiftieth record to it:

      <remarks>
        DBServer:OrderKeyCount() counts the keys in the specified order and returns the result as a numeric value.  If the order is not conditional and no scope has been set for it, DBServer:OrderKeyCount() is identical to DBServer:RecCount, returning the number of records in the data server.  However, for a conditional order, there may be fewer keys than there are records, since some records may not meet the order's for condition or may not fall inside the scope specified by DBServer:OrderScope() — in counting the keys, DBServer:OrderKeyCount() respects the currently defined scope and for condition.
        <note type="tip">
          If there is no order in operation, DBServer:OrderKeyCount() will return 0 and not the value of DBServer:RecCount().

        Tip:  This method can be useful for displaying scroll bars and messages such as "Record 9 of 123" when viewing records in a browser.
        By default, DBServer:OrderKeyNo() operates on the currently selected work area.  It will operate on an unselected work area if you specify it as part of an aliased expression.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        This example shows the difference between physical and logical record number:
        <code language="X#">
          oDBCust := Customer{}&#0009;// Assuming 1000 records
          oDBCust:SetIndex("first")&#0009;// Make records in first name order
          ? oDBCust:OrderKeyNo()&#0009;// Result: 1
          oDBCust:Skip(10)

      <returns>
        TRUE if the record is unchanged and the lock was successfully taken; otherwise, FALSE.
      </returns>
      <remarks>
        This method checks for pending updates to the current record by comparing the values that were read to the record when the server was initially positioned on the record with the current values in the corresponding database record.
        If the values match, it signifies that no other user has modified the data since the user started working on it, and, therefore, that it is safe to lock the record and let the user continue with an update transaction.  (Note that when locked, other users can still make read-only reference to the record.)
        If the values do not match, somebody else has changed the record, and the user should refresh the values from disk and  restart the transaction.  The application has to decide what to do about values that are different.  Note that DBServer:Status can be used to determine the reason for the failure.
        This method is used for optimistic concurrency control.  (See "Concurrency Control" in the Programmer's Guide  for more information.)

        DBServer:Seek() moves to the first logical record whose key value is equal to &lt;uKey&gt;.  If such a record is found, it becomes the current record and DBServer:Seek() returns TRUE.  Otherwise, DBServer:Seek() returns FALSE and the positioning of the data server is as follows: for a normal (not soft) seek, the data server is positioned to DBServer:LastRec + 1 and DBServer:EOF returns TRUE; for a soft seek, the data server is positioned to the first record whose key value is greater than the specified key value.  If no such record exists, the data server is positioned to DBServer:LastRec + 1 and DBServer:EOF returns TRUE.
        For a data server with no controlling order, DBServer:Seek() has no effect.

        The FOR condition is stored as part of the index file and used when updating or recreating the index using the DBServer:Reindex() method.  The FOR clause provides the only scoping that is maintained for all database changes.  All other scope conditions create orders that do not reflect database updates.<br/>

        The WHILE condition is transient (that is, it is not stored in the file and not used for index updates and reindexing purposes). The WHILE condition creates temporary orders, but these orders are not updated.<br/>
        Using the WHILE condition is more efficient and faster than using the FOR condition.  The WHILE condition processes only data for which &lt;cbWhileCondition&gt; is TRUE from the current position.  The FOR condition, in contrast, processes all data in the data source.

        DBSCOPEREST&#0009;The scope is the remaining records in the table from the current position.<br/>
        &lt;nRecords&gt;&#0009;The scope is the next &lt;nRecords&gt; records.
      </param>
      <returns>
        TRUE if successful; otherwise, FALSE.  Note that after a FALSE indication of a scoped operation, some records can have been written to the target file: the operation can have failed halfway through because of lock conflicts or technical problems.

      <summary>
        Allows the programmer greater control over Windows message handling in dialog windows.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        Normally a dialog window will cause program execution to pause when the window is shown and then continue once the window is closed. The default behavior of ExecModal( ) maintains the expected behavior.
        However the programmer can create a new class which inherits from DialogWindow and implement a new ExecModal() method so as to change this behavior.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        As an example the programmer could use the following version which performs no action:
        <code language="X#">
          METHOD ExecModal() CLASS DialogWindow
             RETURN NIL
        </code>
        Now the program control comes back immediately after calling the Show() method. This is very useful for cases where your code wants to control the windows dispatcher loop with the function ApplicationExec(EXECWHILEEVENT):
        <code language="X#">
          METHOD xyz() CLASS xyz
             LOCAL oPDlg AS ProgressDialog // inherit from DialogWindow

             oPDlg := ProgressDialog{SELF, "Processing is going on!"}
             oPDlg:Count := oServer:Reccount
             oPDlg:Show()

             //ProgressDialog is modal, the user can do
            // nothing during the processing other than what
             // your code permits.
             //In this example you can abort the loop.

             oServer:GoTop()

             DO WHILE oServer:EOF
                 IF ! oPDlg:STEP()  //FALSE if abort button is pressed

          When creating windows without using the Window Editor there is a difference between the DialogWindow class and all other Window classes.
          With the other window classes it is possible to write code like this -
          <code language="X#">
            LOCAL oDW AS DataWindow
            oDW := DataWindow{ oOwner }
            oDW:Show( )
          </code>
          However, this code will not work -
          <code language="X#">
            LOCAL oDW AS DialogWindow
            oDW := DialogWindow{ oOwner }
            oDW:Show( )
          </code>
          It is possible to use a generated resource for a blank DialogWindow and inherit from this. The alternative is to do something like this -
          <code language="X#">
            &#0009;oWin := DialogWindow{ oOwner, "IDD_DEFDLG2", TRUE }
            &#0009;oWin:Size := Dimension{ 100 , 100 }
            &#0009;oWin:Show( SHOWCENTERED )
          </code>
          Or
          <code language="X#">
            &#0009;oWin := DialogWindow{ oOwner, "IDD_DEFDLG", FALSE }
            &#0009;oWin:Size := Dimension{ 100 , 100 }
            &#0009;oWin:Show( )
          </code>
          The difference between these two pieces of code is -
          <code language="X#">
            - The first uses the "IDD_DEFDLG2" resource ID and sets the modal property to TRUE. This will create a normal style dialog window and is known as a Pop-Up Dialog.
            - The second uses the "IDD_DEFDLG" resource ID and sets the modal property to FALSE. This is the style of dialog window that would be used as a Tab Page and is known as a Child Dialog.

        To display a DrawObject object, call Window:Draw() with the DrawObject object as its argument.  The window does the drawing by asking each object to draw itself — for example:
        <code language="X#">
          METHOD Expose(oEvent) CLASS MyWindow
          &#0009;LOCAL oEllipse AS ELLIPSEOBJECT

          &#0009;&#0009;Dimension{50,100}}
          &#0009;SELF:Draw(oEllipse)
          &#0009;// Calls the method Draw() on oEllipse

        FONTSCRIPT&#0009;Similar to script handwriting, e.g. .
        FONTSWISS&#0009;Similar to Helvetica.
        Defining what font you want is potentially complicated, for two reasons:  different computers may have different sets of fonts installed and the same font may have different names on different computers.  For example, the Helvetica font family which looks like this: Helvetica, is known as Helv, Helvetica, Arial, Swiss or MS Sans Serif, depending on what system you are using.  The standard name for this font here is FontSwiss.
        To ensure that a program will work, regardless of what fonts are available on each computer, the Font class provides automatic methods for finding a reasonable match to the font you specify.
        In practice, however, as long as you use the most common names you will not have a problem since all versions of Windows after 3.1 contain the standard fonts.
        For example, to create a font of 10 pt Times New Roman and one of 8 pt Helvetica:
        <code language="X#">
          oFontRoman := Font{FONTROMAN10}&#0009;//
          oFontSwiss := Font{FONTSWISS8}&#0009;&#0009;//
        </code>
        The system allows you to reference any font installed on the machine.  For example, to create a font of 12 pt Palatino,
        <code language="X#">oMyFont := Font{,Dimension{12,12},"Palatino"}&#0009;// </code>
        Or a font of 16 pt Arial:
        <code language="X#">oMyFont := Font{, 16, "Arial"}   // </code>
        That approach, of course, is vulnerable to the font not being available.  If Palatino is not available, the system would choose a reasonable facsimile, and if it had never heard of Palatino, this might not be a good match.  To help the system come up with a reasonable match, you can specify what font family Palatino belongs to:
        <code language="X#">oMyFont := Font{FONTROMAN, Dimension{12,12},"Palatino"}</code>
        In this case, we would get Times Roman if Palatino was not available.
        You can specify the family only.  For example, to create a 10 pt font in whatever is available in the script family:
        <code language="X#">oMyFont := Font{FONTSCRIPT,Dimension{10,10}}</code>

      <param name="cDescription">The purpose of the host object.  For a control, the purpose tells the user what the control is for.  By default, when a control gets focus, the system displays the control's hyperlabel's description upon the status bar.  Similarly, when the user drags the mouse across the menu, each time a new command is highlighted, its hyperlabel's description appears in the status bar.  If you supply the resource ID of a string, HyperLabel:Init() extracts the string.  If not specified, the default is NULL_STRING.</param>
      <param name="cHelpContext">The string that uniquely identifies the place to jump in the hypertext help system.  In the case of Windows, this is just the context name.  The system uses the object's hyperlabel's help context to decide where to jump when the user asks for in-context help about the host object.  If you supply the resource ID of a string, HyperLabel:Init() extracts the string.  If not specified, the default is NULL_STRING.</param>

      <param name="aContents">
        An array containing the values to be placed in the list box.  A two-dimensional array may be used to define the values to be returned to the program when a list item is selected, separately from the text strings shown in the list; this 'other' value is what is returned in the ListBox:Value property, and what is stored in the database if the control is associated with a database field. <br/>
        &#0009;Thus, the array may be specified in one of two formats:
      </param>
      <param name="1.">One-dimensional array containing the list of values. </param>
      <param name="2.">
        Array of two-element arrays, each containing the string to display in the list and the corresponding value returned to the program.<br/>

      <param name="symField2">The symbolic name of the field that is to be used for the values that are returned to the program.  If not specified, the values of the first field are used.</param>
      <remarks>
        A list box shows the set of valid values for a field.  Depending on what type of list box is used, the set of values may act as a constraint on the values that may be retrieved or only as a suggestion.  Two sets of values may be specified, allowing for translation of values between the displayed, "human-readable" representation and the internal, programmatic value.
        The FillUsing() method provides a way of specifying the values to be included in the list all at once, instead of constructing the list item by item with the AddItem() method.
        <note type="tip">The list box control may be associated with a database field, just like any other control.  Do not confuse this primary field linkage with the possibility of linking the list box to a secondary server used for populating the list.</note>

        Create a list box with different currencies, showing an explicit representation to the user but using a different representation internally:

      <remarks>
        Init() initializes an OLEAutoObject and tries to link it to the specified automation server.
        Usually, you will specify the automation server (OLE defined PROGID) using its name as a string (i.e., &lt;cServer&gt;).  You can, however, specify it as an object of the IDispatch class (i.e., &lt;oIDispatch&gt;).  This is required to handle interface hierarchies in OLE automation.  A method, property, or variable might return an OLE interface, that in turn represents an automation object with its own methods, properties, and variables.  The invoke logic of the automation class will automatically turn a returned OLE automation interface in a new OLEAutoObject object, by first creating an IDispatch object, then creating a new OLEAutoObject object and passing the IDispatch object to its Init() method.
        Alternate parameters are an IDispatch pointer or an OleAutoObject.  IDispatch Pointers are handled just like IDispatch objects. When you pass in an OleAutoObject X# will create a second OleAutoObject that points to the same COM Interface. X# will make sure that the reference counting is adjusted to reflect the fact that TWO VO Objects are passing to the same OLE Object.
        The invoke logic in generated subclasses of OLEAutoObject handles return OLE automation interfaces in this manner, so that normally there is no need for the user to pass IDispatch objects to OLEAutoObject:Init().
        OLE automation servers might support different languages for the names of methods, properties, and variables.  The desired language is specified through the &lt;nLangID&gt; argument.  The value zero tells the server to use its default language.  For details about the supported languages, their identifiers, and the default language, refer to the documentation for your specific automation server.
        The &lt;lNoFuncArray&gt; parameter has to be considered reserved.  It is only used by generated subclasses of OLEAutoObject to prevent the Init() method from creating OLEAutoObject:aFuncDesc (an array containing descriptions for all methods, properties, and variables of the automation server).  Because this array is not needed by generated subclasses of OLEAutoObject, they call the Init() method using a value of TRUE for this argument.  The default value, and the value that is normally used, is FALSE.
        The &lt;fROTCheck&gt; parameter determines if X# will create a new instance of the server or if it will try to see if the server is already running. The default behavior is to create a new server (fROTCheck = FALSE). When you specify a TRUE for this parameter,  X#will inspect the OLE Running Objects Table and try to attach to an already running server by calling the GetActiveObject() API function. When that fails, X# will create a new server

        Constant&#0009;Meaning
        NOTIFYAPPEND&#0009;A blank record has been appended to the server; the server is still positioned on this new record, and its values have not been finalized.
        NOTIFYCLEARRELATION&#0009;Not sent to a data window.
        NOTIFYCLOSE&#0009;The server intends to close itself.
        NOTIFYCOMPLETION&#0009;The server has completed some large operation that did not involve repositioning of the server or change to the data (such as reindexing).  This gives the window a chance to update visual indication to the user that some operation has been completed.  &lt;uDescription&gt; is the name of the method that was just completed, as a symbol.
        NOTIFYDELETE&#0009;The current record has been deleted, and the server is now positioned according to its rules for how a deletion is handled.  The window should refresh its display accordingly.
        NOTIFYFIELDCHANGE&#0009;A field has changed.  &lt;uDescription&gt; is the field name as a symbol.  Note that the window might not contain a control with the indicated name.  The server knows only that it has a field of that name and that it changed, and it notifies all its clients in case they are interested.
        NOTIFYFILECHANGE&#0009;The server has executed some method that perform many changes to the data; all the window's knowledge about the server and its data is potentially obsolete, and it should refresh all information from the server and all calculations that depend on the data or its position.
        NOTIFYGOBOTTOM&#0009;The server has moved to its last record.  Many clients treat this merely as a record change, but windows in browse view can treat a positioning-to-the-end as a special case.
        NOTIFYGOTOP&#0009;The server has moved to its first record.  Many clients treat this merely as a record change, but windows in browse view can treat a positioning-to-the-top as a special case.
        NOTIFYINTENTTOMOVE&#0009;The server intends to make a move.  (Note that the move may have been initiated by another client.)The window should make sure that all its data is saved, if necessary, before the movement is done.  The standard implementation checks validation status.  If the window contains data that is invalid, the user has a choice of correcting the errors or discarding the data.
        NOTIFYRECORDCHANGE&#0009;The record position of the server has changed.  All clients are notified after any movement, so they can refresh their displays from the server.  &lt;uDescription&gt; might indicate the length of the move (the number of records).  The window can use this information for display optimization but cannot rely on its availability.
        NOTIFYRELATIONCHANGE&#0009;Not sent to data windows (relation changes among servers are transmitted to clients as file changes).
        This Notify() method is at the heart of the automatic notification among linked browsers and servers, allowing any window to make a change to a field value or initiate a movement and also ensuring that all client windows reflect the change.  Any class that is registered as a client of a server must respond intelligently to the Notify message.  In addition to the functionality provided by the DataWindow base class, the implementation for the OLEDataWindow class also deactivates any activated OLE objects before doing database operations, such as SKIPs.
        As always with defined constants, you should never rely on the actual values of the constants -- they will not necessarily stay the same.  However, the constants do maintain their order:
        Constant&#0009;Value Level
        NOTIFYFIELDCHANGE&#0009;Lowest
        NOTIFYCLOSE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYCOMPLETION&#0009;...
        NOTIFYINTENTTOMOVE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYRECORDCHANGE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYGOBOTTOM&#0009;...
        NOTIFYGOTOP&#0009;...
        NOTIFYDELETE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYAPPEND&#0009;...
        NOTIFYFILECHANGE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYRELATIONCHANGE&#0009;...
        NOTIFYCLEARRELATION&#0009;Highest
        Thus, you can reliably write:
        <code language="X#">
          IF    kNotifyName &gt; NOTIFYINTENTTOMOVE;
          &#0009;.AND. kNotifyName &lt; NOTIFYFILECHANGE

      <remarks>
        A OLE object usually supports several actions (called verbs) which a user can perform on the object.  An AVI object, for example, can support a Play and an Edit verb.  The object's verbs can be invoked via its verb menu, which is added using OLEObject:AddVerbMenu() into an existing menu and is fully managed by the object.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following code inserts the verb menu at position two of the pop-up menu with ID one of the container application.  Note that the system menu of an MDI child window counts as separate pop-up menu, in case the MDI child window is maximized:
        <code language="X#">

        Each object provided by an OLE server is uniquely identified by its program ID.  These program IDs are stored in the system Registry as described in the OLE server's documentation.  OLEObject:CreateEmbedding() creates an embedded OLE object from its program ID and loads it into an OLEObject container.

        X# supports the ability to store an OLE object in a DBF database.  To assign a new value to the OLEObject container, you pass an OLEDBStorage object to OLEObject:CreateFromDBStorage().  To save the persistent information of an OLE object in the database, you pass an OLEDBStorage object to OLEObject:SaveToDBStorage().  You usually get the OLEDBStorage object as a result of a FieldGet() call.

        This method can be used when an OLEObject object is no longer needed.  OLEObject:Destroy() de-instantiates the OLEObject object and allows you to close and free any resources that were opened or created by the object, without waiting for the garbage collector.  The associated OLE object is automatically closed and the OLE object's server is shut down, unless it is serving other clients.

        Since OLEObject serves as a container for any OLE object, it is possible to remove the current object, cut the link to its server, and load a new OLE object into the container by using one of the Create methods.  In the process, OLEObject:DetachFromServer() removes the current OLE object and cuts the link to the object's server.

        X# supports the ability to store an OLE object in a DBF database.  To assign a new value to the OLEObject container, you pass an OLEDBStorage object to OLEObject:CreateFromDBStorage().  To save the persistent information of an OLE object in the database, you pass an OLEDBStorage object to OLEObject:SaveToDBStorage().  You usually get the OLEDBStorage object as a result of a FieldGet() call.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following code shows how to load an OLE object form a database and save it back again:
        <code language="X#">
          LOCAL oDBStg AS OLEDBStorage
          oDBStg := FieldGet(FieldPos(#PaintObject))
          oOLEContainer:CreateFromDBStorage(oDBStg)
          // do some editing with the OLE object
          oOLEContainer:SaveToDBStorage(oDBStg)
        </code>

      <remarks>
        Whenever an OLE object is in-place active, the server's toolbars can replace the X# container application's toolbars.  In response to a resizing of the container application, OLEObject:UpdateToolbars() causes the OLE object server to rearrange its toolbars.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following code shows how a X# container application uses OLEObject:UpdateToolbars() in response to a resize event:
        <code language="X#">

        Provide the prototype dispatcher for events within the system when the OLE shell window has focus, routing various events to their appropriate event handlers.

        TRUE if the event was handled; otherwise, FALSE.

      <remarks>
        This method serves as an internal callback, dispatching events to various event handlers.  It should never be necessary to call this method directly.  Instead, you can write your own Dispatch() method for derived classes if you want to handle additional events.  Usually the derived class Dispatch() should call SUPER:Dispatch() to support the inherited event handling.
        In addition to the functionality provided by the ShellWindow base class, the implementation for the OLEShellWindow class also includes support for handling in-place active OLE objects. For example, whenever the shell window is resized, it automatically asks the activated OLE objects to update their toolbars.

        For fixed structures, the individual radio buttons may be created as regular controls, either dynamically or through a resource entity, and assigned to the group through the FillUsing() method.
        <note type="tip">The radio button group may be associated with a database field, just like any other control.</note>
      </remarks>
      <example>
        Create a radio button group with different currencies, showing an explicit representation to the user but using a different representation internally.
        This example, shown below, with the radio buttons explicitly created through a resource entity.  The code simply links the radio buttons to the group:

    <member name="M:VO.ReportQueue.Close">
      <summary>
        Close a report.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        When a program has finished with a report, it should close the report to reduce the Report Editor's memory usage.  This does not close the Report Editor; only the open report within it.
        The ReportQueue keeps a stack of the reports it opened by calls to the ReportQueue:Open() method (but it does not have visibility to the extra files the user opens via the Report Editor's menu).  Once all reports are closed (via the ReportQueue:Close() method or the Report Editor menu), the ReportQueue knows of no reports that are open and rejects any further calls to print, preview, or export "the current report," until the next ReportQueue:Open() call.
        ReportQueue:Close() displays its status in the owner window's status bar.
        Even if the ReportQueue believes that the Report Editor has no report open, the Close() method still sends the FILE.CLOSE command to the Report Editor.  This command is quietly ignored by the Report Editor, so it is always safe to call ReportQueue:Close().
        The ReportQueue:Close() method totally closes a report.  The ReportQueue:Close() method closes a preview (if open), and/or closes the report definition, depending on which window type is open.
        The Report Editor advises the ReportQueue whenever a report or view is closed (whether the close was initiated by ReportQueue or the user).
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following example closes a report definition:
        <code language="X#">
          LOCAL oReportQueue := ReportQueue{SELF,;
          &#0009;"Report Editor"}
          oReportQueue:Open("one.ret")
          oReportQueue:Close()

    <member name="M:VO.ReportQueue.CloseAll">
      <summary>
        Close all reports.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        CloseAll() displays its status in the owner window's status bar.  It leaves both the Report Editor server and your program running.  CloseAll() can be called safely at any time, and is probably useful both in exception handlers and in clean-up routines.

        The Report Editor requires an active database connection.  Before opening a report, you must create a data source for the report database.

        The following example connects to a "CA Xbase" data source:

      <remarks>
        This method executes outstanding ReportQueue methods (either commands, like Print() and SaveToFile() or Report Editor appearance methods).  Once a report is opened, subsequent command methods can take an array of report parameters to be inserted into the Report Editor report text and/or database query.  The Report Editor's appearance can be changed synchronously, but the Report Editor performs commands asynchronously and all subsequent commands and appearance changes are queued within the ReportQueue until the Report Editor advises that it has finished the previous command.
        The ReportQueue methods post messages on their owner window's status bar whenever they send a command to the Report Editor and replace it with a confirmation on completing each command.

        Important!  This is a callback method used by X#.  Normally, it should not be called in your application code.
      </summary>

      <param name="oHelpRequestEvent">The HelpRequestEvent object that describes which item help is being requested for.</param>
      <remarks>
        This event handler is invoked only if the help mechanism has been enabled for the current window (or one of its owners).
        The help mechanism is enabled by assigning a HelpDisplay object to the windows HelpDisplay property.
        The default implementation of this event handler is to display the help topic that is associated with the control, menu command, or window region with focus when the HelpRequestEvent was generated.  This is accomplished using HelpDisplay:Show(&lt;cKeyword&gt;), where &lt;cKeyword&gt; is either a HyperLabel:HelpContext property or a default keyword generated by this event handler in cases where a hyperlabel is not available.
        If there is no hyperlabel for an item, the keyword generated is as follows:
        &#0009;A HELPCONTROL request generates the keyword Control_xxxx, where xxxx is the numeric ID of the control, in decimal.  For example, an OK push button might generate the keyword Control_101.
        &#0009;A HELPMENU request generates the keyword Menu_xxxx, where xxxx is the "cleaned" text of the menu command.  The cleaned text has all leading and trailing spaces and the ampersand character (&amp;) removed.  In addition, all sequences of spaces are replaced by a single underscore, and the string is truncated at the first tab character.
        &#0009;For example, the keyword generated for the menu command:
        &#0009;Save &amp;As\tF3
        &#0009;is
        &#0009;Menu_Save_As
        &#0009;A HELPWINDOW request generates one of the keywords listed in the table below, depending on the window region that has focus.
        Keyword&#0009;Window Region
        Window_Border&#0009;Border
        Window_Caption&#0009;Title bar
        Window_MaxBox&#0009;Maximize button
        Window_MinBox&#0009;Minimize button
        Window_SysMenuBox&#0009;System menu button
        Window_Unknown&#0009;Any area of the window not explicitly identified in this table
        Window_WindowCanvas&#0009;Canvas area
        <note type="tip">If the Window_Unknown keyword is generated, the default behavior of HelpRequest() is to display the Contents topic as defined in the HelpDisplay (that is, HelpDisplay:Show("HelpIndex")).</note>
        If a HELPWINDOW request is received, while Window:HelpContext is defined, Window:HelpRequest() uses the HelpContext property, regardless of the window region that has focus.
        Refer to the "GUI Classes" chapter in the Programmer's Guide for more information on programming an online help system for your application.

        It should never be necessary to call this method directly.  Instead, you can write your own OnOLEStatusMessage() method for derived classed if you want to change the default implementation.

        This method is used to actually perform the insertion of a row into the table after the SQLSelect:Append() and SQLSelect:FieldPut() operations have been performed, which insert a blank row into the buffer and assign values into the buffer.
        It is not necessary to call SQLSelect:AppendRow() in all cases, since it will be called automatically when the position is changed (for example, using GoTop(), Skip(), etc.), using the values in the buffer.

      <remarks>
        The exact implications of this action depend on the server.  With some database management systems, the method commits all servers using the same connection; with others, it commits only this server; and with yet others the method does nothing.  In addition, some SQL servers have other implications of a commit operation (they can close cursors, for example).  This is an area that is not standardized; you should carefully study the documentation for your database management system.
        The AutoCommit option may interfere with manual commits.  You may want to turn AutoCommit off, for example:

        The standard Error() handling method fills in some more information about the errors and about the SQLSelect object that originates the error, sets the status value for the server object, and passes the problem to its client, if there is one, in its standard Error() handling method.  If there is no client who wants to deal with the problem, the method passes it up the call stack by issuing a BREAK with the same Error object.

        For SQLSelect, this method is used to intercept references to column names as exported variables, which ordinarily would not be allowed.  If the column name is valid, it does a FieldPut() for the corresponding column name with the passed value, in effect turning table columns into Assign methods of each SQLSelect object.  See "Objects, Classes, and Methods" in the Programmer's Guide for more information on NoIVarPut().

        This command discards all changes to the current row.  It is useful as a way of implementing Undo in an application.

      </returns>
      <remarks>
        Some servers lack support for this operation.  If the server does support it, the exact implications of a rollback vary with the server — with some database management systems, the method rolls back all servers using the same connection; with others, it rolls back only this server.  In addition, some SQL servers have other implications of a rollback operation (they can close cursors, for example).  This is an area that is that is not standardized in SQL; you should carefully study the documentation for your database management system.

      <remarks>
        Enabling a status bar allows it to generate events and to send the events to its owner window when the user manipulates the status bar.  The dimming of disabled status bar is removed, and the status bar is restored to its normal appearance.
        By default, status bars are enabled until disabled, so there is no need to call this Enable() method unless StatusBar:Disable() was previously called.

        A balloon tip can be displayed, pointing to an edit control.

        The tip always points to the current cursor position within the control, and is dismissed by either clicking on it, by moving focus to a control other than the control the tip is assigned to, or by typing into the text box. Showing the tip automatically sets focus to the control at the last cursor position. A form can not show more than one tip at a time, and if the tip is repeatedly shown, the previous tip is destroyed first. Tips never get focus, and there is no message sent when the tip is dismissed. If the tip is not dismissed before the system timeout value for tool tips is reached, it automatically disappears leaving focus on the control.

        The ToolBar:AddBand() method adds a new band to the toolbar.  Bands are separate areas of a toolbar control, or window, which that can be resized and moved by the end user.  Each band can hold a text, an image, and a control.  Additionally, foreground and background colors, as well as a background bitmap, can be specified.  If you want to create a band holding a sub-toolbar as a control, use ToolBar:AddSubToolBarBand().

        &#0009;For custom toolbar buttons, append an item labeled IDT_CUSTOMBITMAP.  (For example, for the first button, the &lt;nButtonID&gt; is IDT_CUSTOMBITMAP + 1; the second is IDT_CUSTOMBITMAP + 2, and so on.)

        &#0009;It is possible to have the custom buttons in individual bitmap resource files, and create a Bitmap object for each button.  &lt;nPosition&gt; is set to 1 if you use this method.  It is recommended to use a ribbon of buttons in one bitmap file, as this only uses one handle.  The latter method will use a handle for each object created.

      <returns>
        TRUE if successful; otherwise, FALSE.
      </returns>
      <remarks>
        Both the event triggered, when the button is clicked, and the description that shows up in the status bar are based on the properties of the associated menu.  Thus, the toolbar controls the action of the application indirectly, through its associated menu.
        Specifying a toolbar by calling this method for each standard toolbar button might seem cumbersome.  The recommended way to define the toolbar is to use the Menu Editor, which automatically generates code to lay out the toolbar.
        Note that the user can modify the set of button items on the toolbar with the configuration dialog.  The program does not need to concern itself with what buttons exist, since the events come in as if they were menu selections.
        In order to reduce "visual noise" (undesirable blinking and flicker), the toolbar does not immediately reflect a button added with ToolBar:AppendItem().  Instead, you must call ToolBar:Update() to make all the new buttons show up at once.  The ToolBar:Show() method automatically updates the display.  For toolbars that are defined once and for all and attached to a window, there is no need for explicitly calling ToolBar:Update(), it is intended only for toolbars that change their button configuration on the fly.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following example adds two custom bitmaps to the toolbar:

          DEFINE BUTTON_ONE := 1
          DEFINE BUTTON_TWO := 2
          DEFINE FIRST_BUTTON := IDT_CUSTOMBITMAP + BUTTON_ONE
          DEFINE SECOND_BUTTON := IDT_CUSTOMBITMAP + BUTTON_TWO

      <remarks>
        A toolbar is usually assigned to a window simply by attaching it to its corresponding menu; when the menu is assigned to the window, the toolbar is assigned as well.  (It is also possible to explicitly assign a toolbar separately from its menu, using the AppWindow:ToolBar property.)
        Instantiating the toolbar does not make it visible and active.  The toolbar becomes alive only when attached to a window in the same way as a menu.  To reduce "visual noise"(undesirable blinking and flicker), the configuration of the buttons and layout of the toolbar should be completed before it is assigned to the window and made visible.
        To define the button layout of a toolbar, you use the AppendItem() and InsertItem() methods.  Note that the item IDs must be coordinated with the corresponding menu item IDs.  The easiest way to manage this correspondence is to use the Menu Editor, which automatically generates the corresponding code.
        A toolbar can be placed on any type of window.  Note however, that the window takes up some of the area of the window, leaving less space to work with.  Shell windows and data windows automatically adapt to the toolbar, but if you place a toolbar on another kind of window you need to accommodate the change explicitly.  Use the ToolBar:ClientArea property to determine how much room is left.

      <returns>
        TRUE if successful; otherwise, FALSE.
      </returns>
      <remarks>
        Both the event triggered when the button is clicked and the description that shows up in the status bar are based on the properties of the associated menu.  Thus, the toolbar controls the action of the application indirectly, through its associated menu.
        Specifying a toolbar by calling this method for each button might seem cumbersome.  The recommended way to define the toolbar is to use the Menu Editor, which automatically generates code to lay out the toolbar.
        Note that the user can modify the set of button items on the toolbar with the configuration dialog.  The program does not need to concern itself with what buttons exist, since the events come in as if they were menu selections.
        In order to reduce "visual noise" (undesirable blinking and flicker), the toolbar does not immediately reflect a button added with InsertItem().  Instead, you must call Update() to make all the new buttons show up at once.  The Show() method automatically updates the display.  For toolbars that are defined once and for all and attached to a window, there is no need for explicitly calling Update(), it is intended only for toolbars that change their button configuration on the fly.

        You should create and show cursors (if needed) in this event handler method.
        Any subclass with its own Activate() and Deactivate() event handlers should always call its owner's handlers.  This ensures that the caption bars get highlighted or dimmed accordingly.

        Button click events (radio, check, and push buttons) are propagated to the window's owner the same way as MenuEvents.  For an in-depth discussion on command event propagation, refer to the Programmer's Guide.
        You must supply the code to turn a radio button on (and all the other radio buttons off) when a user clicks on a radio button.  Similarly, you must also be sure to invert the state of a check box when it is clicked.

        If Window:EditFocusChange() is used to validate an edit control (and also return the focus to it if invalid), Control:SetFocus() should not be called until another control has received the focus.
        In complex dialog windows that contain many edit controls, it makes sense to grab the edit control's text when the focus is changing so that other controls can be updated with it if necessary.
        See the ButtonClick() method for an example of similar syntax to be used in this method.  Note that none of the button controls are passed through this method, only SingleLineEdit and MultiLineEdit controls.  If looking to control Combobox selections, then use the ListBoxSelect() callback method.

      </summary>

      <param name="oHelpRequestEvent">The HelpRequestEvent object that describes which item help is being requested for.</param>
      <remarks>
        This event handler is invoked only if the help mechanism has been enabled for the current window (or one of its owners).  The help mechanism is enabled by assigning a HelpDisplay object to the windows HelpDisplay property.
        The default implementation of this event handler is to display the help topic that is associated with the control, menu command, or window region with focus when the HelpRequestEvent was generated.  This is accomplished using HelpDisplay:Show(&lt;cKeyword&gt;), where &lt;cKeyword&gt; is either a HyperLabel:HelpContext property or a default keyword generated by this event handler in cases where a hyperlabel is not available.
        If there is no hyperlabel for an item, the keyword generated is as follows:
        &#0009;A HELPCONTROL request generates the keyword Control_xxxx, where xxxx is the numeric ID of the control, in decimal.  For example, an OK push button might generate the keyword Control_101.
        &#0009;A HELPMENU request generates the keyword Menu_xxxx, where xxxx is the "cleaned" text of the menu command.  The cleaned text has all leading and trailing spaces and the ampersand character (&amp;) removed.  In addition, all sequences of spaces are replaced by a single underscore, and the string is truncated at the first tab character.
        &#0009;For example, the keyword generated for the menu command:
        &#0009;Save &amp;As\tF3
        &#0009;is
        &#0009;Menu_Save_As
        &#0009;A HELPWINDOW request generates one of the keywords listed in the table below, depending on the window region that has focus:
        Keyword&#0009;Window Region
        Window_Border&#0009;Border
        Window_Caption&#0009;Title bar
        Window_MaxBox&#0009;Maximize button
        Window_MinBox&#0009;Minimize button
        Window_SysMenuBox&#0009;System menu button
        Window_Unknown&#0009;Any area of the window not explicitly identified in this table
        Window_WindowCanvas&#0009;Canvas area
        <note type="tip">If the Window_Unknown keyword is generated, the default behavior of HelpRequest() is to display the Contents topic as defined in the HelpDisplay (that is, HelpDisplay:Show("HelpIndex")).</note>
        If a HELPWINDOW request is received, while Window:HelpContext is defined, Window:HelpRequest() uses the HelpContext property, regardless of the window region that has focus.
