    <para styleclass="Normal">The dynamic type enables the operations in which it occurs to bypass compile-time type checking. Instead, these operations are resolved at run time. The dynamic type simplifies access to COM APIs such as the Office Automation APIs, and also to dynamic APIs such as IronPython libraries, and to the HTML Document Object Model (DOM).</para>

    <para styleclass="Normal">Type dynamic behaves like type object in most circumstances. However, operations that contain expressions of type dynamic are not resolved or type checked by the compiler. The compiler packages together information about the operation, and that information is later used to evaluate the operation at run time. As part of the process, variables of type dynamic are compiled into variables of type object. Therefore, type dynamic exists only at compile time, not at run time.<br/></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal">Please not that to use the DYNAMIC type in your app you have to include the Microsoft.CSharp DLL at this moment, and the property names and method names are case sensitive at this moment.</para>
