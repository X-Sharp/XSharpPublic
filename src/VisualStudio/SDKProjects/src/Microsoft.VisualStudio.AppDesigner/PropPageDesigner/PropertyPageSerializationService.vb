    'CONSIDER: Use GenericComponentSerializationService/Store

    ''' <summary>
    ''' This is a class that enables the UndoEngine to "serialize" our PropPageDesignerRootComponent instances
    '''
    '''  Comments from the (abstract) ComponentSerializationService from which this derives:
    '''
    '''      This class serializes a set of components or serializable objects into a 
    '''     serialization store.  The store can then be deserialized at a later 
    '''     date.  ComponentSerializationService differs from other serialization 
    '''     schemes in that the serialization format is opaque, and it allows for 
    '''     partial serialization of objects.  For example, you can choose to 
    '''     serialize only selected properties for an object.
    '''     
    '''     This class is abstract. Typically a DesignerLoader will provide a 
    '''     concrete implementation of this class and add it as a service to 
    '''     its DesignSurface.  This allows objects to be serialized in the 
    '''     format best suited for them.
