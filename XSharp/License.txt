XSHARP COMPILER SOURCE CODE LICENSE - V 1.0

Version effective date: Sept 15, 2015

The accompanying program is provided under the terms of this XSharp 
compiler source code license ("agreement"). Any use, reproduction or 
distribution of the program constitutes subscriber's acceptance of 
this agreement.

1. DEFINITIONS

“Program” means the source code of the XSharp compiler

"Contribution" means:
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and 
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
      i) changes to the Program, and
      ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from 
and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by 
such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's 
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: 
      (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction 
with the Program under their own license agreement, 
      (ii) are not derivative works of the Program or 
      (iii) are not seen as substantial changes or additions by 
XSharp BV.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor 
which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its 
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

The “Friends Of XSharp” (FOX) community program is the subscription 
service under which the XSharp project, represented by XSharp BV, 
publishes the source code for the XSharp Compiler for its 
subscribers.

“Binary Form” means a compiled version of the Program.

2. PARTIES

“XSharp BV” is “XSharp BV”, a company from the Netherlands.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that contributes to the 
Program and whose contribution is included by XSharp BV in the 
official distribution of the Program.

"Subscriber" means anyone who subscribes to the FOX program and 
receives the Program under this Agreement, including all 
Contributors and including XSharp BV.

3. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
grants Subscriber a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright 
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such 
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in Binary Form. 
Disclosure of the program other than in binary form to non-
Subscribers is explicitly forbidden.  

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
grants Subscriber a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent 
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, 
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, 
in Binary Form. This patent license shall apply to the combination 
of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution 
is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution 
causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The 
patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which 
include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Subscriber understands that although each Contributor grants the 
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are 
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the 
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. 
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Subscriber for claims 
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual 
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the 
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Subscriber hereby 
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual 
property rights needed, if any. 

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has 
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant 
the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

4. RESTRICTIONS.

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in Binary Form 
under its own license agreement, provided that:
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all 
warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties 
or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties 
or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular 
purpose;
      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all 
liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, 
incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
      iii) states that any provisions which differ from this 
Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other 
party; and
      iv) states that source code for the Program is only available 
for Subscribers.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained 
within the Program.
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its 
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows others to 
identify the originator of the Contribution. 
A complete list of all Contributors will be included with the source 
code of the Program.

5. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and 
the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the 
commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the 
Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner 
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. 
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial 
product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby 
agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified 
Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively 
"Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions 
brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the 
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial 
Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a 
commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not 
apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged 
intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an 
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial 
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial 
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial 
Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. 
The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its 
own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial 
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial 
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance 
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance 
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's 
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor 
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related 
to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires 
any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial 
Contributor must pay those damages.

6. LIMITED WARRANTY

Except as expressly set forth in this agreement, the program is 
provided on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of 
any kind, either express or implied including, without limitation, 
any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, 
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Each Subscriber 
is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using 
and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with 
its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not 
limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with 
applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, 
and unavailability or interruption of operations.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Except as expressly set forth in this agreement, neither subscriber 
nor any contributors shall have any liability for any direct, 
indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages 
(including without limitation lost profits), however caused and on 
any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or 
tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of 
the use or distribution of the program or the exercise of any rights 
granted hereunder, even if advised of the possibility of such 
damages.

8. SEVERABILITY.

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability 
of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further 
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to 
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and 
enforceable.

9. PATENTS.

If Subscriber institutes patent litigation against any entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other 
software or hardware) infringes such Subscriber's patent(s), then 
such Subscriber's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate 
as of the date such litigation is filed.
All Subscriber's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it 
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this 
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of 
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Subscriber's 
rights under this Agreement terminate, Subscriber agrees to cease 
use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably 
practicable. However, Subscriber's obligations under this Agreement 
and any licenses granted by Subscriber relating to the Program shall 
continue and survive.

10. AGREEMENT STEWARD

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this 
Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is 
copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The 
Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions 
(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one 
other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this 
Agreement. XSharp BV is the initial Agreement Steward. XSharp BV may 
assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a 
suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be 
given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including 
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of 
the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new 
version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to 
distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new 
version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, 
Subscriber receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual 
property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, 
by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not 
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

11. JURISDICTION AND VENUE.

This Agreement is governed by the applicable laws of The 
Netherlands. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action 
under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action 
arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting 
litigation.
