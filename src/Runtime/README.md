# XSharpPublic/Runtime
The Runtime Source in this folder is written in X# whenever possible.


#Code formatting
We have added an .EditorConfig in the root of this folder. This helps to ensure consistent code formatting .
Visual Studio 2017 and later will automatically use the settings from this file.
For more info see https://editorconfig.org/
We intend to move the case synchronization setting to this file as well so you can easily ensure consistent case synchronization as well.
