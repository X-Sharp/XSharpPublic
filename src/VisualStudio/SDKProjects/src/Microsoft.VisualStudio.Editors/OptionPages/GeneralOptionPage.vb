    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' The UI itself is implemented by <see cref="GeneralOptionPageControl"/>.
    ''' The options are handled by <see cref="SDKStyleProjectOptionsData"/>.
    ''' This type is responsible for exposing the UI through the <see cref="Child"/>
    ''' property and the settings through the <see cref="AutomationObject"/>
    ''' property.
    ''' Note that at any given time there are up to two copies of <see cref="SDKStyleProjectOptionsData"/>
    ''' in play: the "main" instance holding the values used by other parts of VS,
    ''' and a copy backing the UI. When the user changes a value in the UI only the
    ''' UI copy is updated immediately; the main copy is only updated when the user
    ''' saves their changes. This type is responsible for coordinating the two
    ''' copies.
