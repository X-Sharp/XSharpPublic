# HOW TO: Add a New Launch Profile UI

Launch Profile UIs are defined by instances of the [Rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.build.framework.xamltypes.rule) class. Visual Studio uses these `Rule` objects to dynamically build the UI and bind the controls to launch settings. This HOW TO describes three options for defining and distributing these `Rule` objects:

1. [`Rule` objects read from a .xaml file on disk](#option-1-xaml-file-on-disk)
2. [`Rule` objects read from an embedded .xaml file resource](#option-2-embedded-xaml-file)
3. [`Rule` objects defined in code and exposed via `IRuleObjectProvider`](#option-3-iruleobjectprovider)

At the end your Launch Profile will look something like this:

## Further reading

This HOWTO is concerned with how to create a `Rule` that defines a launch profile UI; however, `Rule` objects are used for various purposes in the project system. For a more general discussion of `Rule`s, please see the following:

- [Adding XAML Rules](https://github.com/microsoft/VSProjectSystem/blob/master/doc/extensibility/adding_xaml_rules.md)
- [Extending XAML Rules](https://github.com/microsoft/VSProjectSystem/blob/master/doc/extensibility/extending_rules.md)

## Option 1: XAML file on disk

In this option, the XAML resides in a standalone .xaml file on disk and is included in the end user's project as a specific kind of MSBuild item, `PropertyPageSchema`. Visual Studio reads these items from the project to determine which kinds of Launch Profiles it can display.

This may be an attractive option if you already have a NuGet package or Visual Studio extension that injects MSBuild .props and .targets files into the end user's project, or if you want to use MSBuild `Condition`s to control when the Launch Profile UI is available to a project. 

### Step 1 (optional): Add the Microsoft.Build.Framework package

Use the NuGet Package Manager to add the Microsoft.Build.Framework package to your project. This is an optional step, but it will allow the XAML editor to find the [Rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.build.framework.xamltypes.rule) type (and related types) and provide code completion, tool tips, Go to Definition, and other features while you type.

### Step 2: Define the XAML file

Add a new XAML file named "MyLaunchProfile.xaml" to your project. Depending on how the file is created you may end up with a `<Page>` item in your project but this is not what we want as we're not using the file to describe a piece of WPF UI.

Update your project to replace the `<Page>` item with one of the following:

- SDK-style projects:
  ``` xml
  <None Update="MyPropertyPage.xaml">
    <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
  </None>
  ```
- Non-SDK-style projects:
  ``` xml
  <None Include="MyPropertyPage.xaml">
    <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
  </None>
  ```

Now VS won't do anything with this file but copy it to the output directory when you build.

### Step 3: Define the `PropertyPageSchema` item

Next you need to update the .props or .targets files imported by the end users' projects to properly reference the property page so Visual Studio can find it. Note that the creation and distribution of the .props and .targets files (as well as the distribution of MyPropertyPage.xaml itself) is beyond the scope of this document.

Add the following item to your .props or .targets file:

``` xml
<PropertyPageSchema Include="path\to\MyLaunchProfile.xaml">
  <Context>Project</Context>
</PropertyPageSchema>
```

Note that the `Context` metadata must be present, and must have the value "Project". Rule objects such as the one defined in these .xaml files are used for multiple purposes in the project system; failing to specify the correct context may prevent your property page from being shown and/or cause bugs elsewhere.

### Step 4: Describe the property page

Replace the contents of MyLaunchProfile.xaml with the following:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<Rule Name="MyLaunchProfile"
      Description="Properties associated with launching and debugging a custom debug target."
      DisplayName="My Custom Debug Target"
      PageTemplate="commandNameBasedDebugger"
      xmlns:sys="clr-namespace:System;assembly=mscorlib"
      xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
      xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/build/2009/properties">

    <Rule.Metadata>
        <sys:String x:Key="CommandName">MyCustomDebugTarget</sys:String>

        <!-- KnownImageIds.ImageCatalogGuid -->
        <sys:Guid x:Key="ImageMonikerGuid">AE27A6B0-E345-4288-96DF-5EAF394EE369</sys:Guid>

        <!-- KnownImageIds.Execute -->
        <sys:Int32 x:Key="ImageMonikerId">1173</sys:Int32>
    </Rule.Metadata>

    <Rule.DataSource>
        <DataSource Persistence="LaunchProfile"
                    HasConfigurationCondition="False"
                    ItemType="LaunchProfile"/>
    </Rule.DataSource>

    <StringProperty Name="ExecutablePath"
                    DisplayName="Executable"
                    Description="Path to the executable to run."
                    Subtype="file" />
</Rule>
```

The format of the file is described in detail in [Property Specification](property-specification.md), but the most important points are:
- The `Name` must be unique.
- The `PageTemplate` attribute must have the value `"commandNameBasedDebugger"`.
- The `Rule.Metadata` element must specify a `CommandName`: this is the debug command name (also known as a debug target) corresponding to this UI. Debug commands and how they are handled by VS are beyond the scope of this document,
- The `ImageMonikerGuid` and `ImageMonikerId` in `Rule.Metadata` together define an ImageMoniker designating the icon to show for this Launch Profile UI. These are optional and if they are not defined a default icon will be supplied.
- The `Rule.DataSource` element must be specified as shown above.
  - The `ItemType` attribute indicates that this `Rule` only pertains to launch profiles, as opposed to other types of items that are typically found in a project (`Compile`, `Reference`, etc.).
  - The `Persistence` attribute indicates that values for the properties should be read and written through the launch profile persistence mechanism, as opposed to trying to read data from the MSBuild file.

Further notes:
- Properties are ordered in the UI as they are ordered in the .xaml file.
- Properties can be placed in categories, just like the properties on property pages. However, the Launch Profiles UI currently ignores categories.

You should now be able to build and see the MyLaunchProfile.xaml copied as-is to the output directory.

And you're done. Projects that import the .targets file will now show this UI when editing the Launch Profiles.

## Option 2: Embedded XAML file

In this option the XAML file is embedded in an assembly as a resource and discovered by means of a MEF export. Compared to Option 1, this requires more initial setup but does not require you to distribute an additional file. This may be an attractive option if you are already exporting MEF components for use in Visual Studio--for example, via an extension.

### Step 1: Add the Project System SDK

Use the NuGet Package Manager to add the Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.SDK package package to your project.

### Step 2: (optional): Add the Microsoft.Build.Framework package

Use the NuGet Package Manager to add the Microsoft.Build.Framework package to your project. This is an optional step, but it will allow the XAML editor to find the [Rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.build.framework.xamltypes.rule) type (and related types) and provide code completion, tool tips, Go to Definition, and other features while you type.

### Step 3: Add the Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.Sdk.Tools package

Use the NuGet Package Manager to add the Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.Sdk.Tools package to your project. This is required to correctly embed the XAML rule at build time.

### Step 4: Define the XAML file

Add a new XAML file named "MyLaunchProfile.xaml" to your project. Depending on how the file is created you may end up with a `<Page>` item in your project but this is not what we want as we're not using the file to describe a piece of WPF UI.

Update your project to replace the `<Page>` item with the following:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <XamlPropertyRule Include="MyLaunchProfile.xaml">
    <CopyToOutputDirectory>Never</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    <Generator>MSBuild:GenerateRuleSourceFromXaml</Generator>
    <SubType>Designer</SubType>
    <DataAccess>None</DataAccess>
    <RuleInjection>None</RuleInjection>
  </XamlPropertyRule>
</ItemGroup>
```

### Step 5: Describe the property page

This is the same as Step 4 under "Option 1: XAML file on disk" (above). Please see that step for details.

### Step 6: Register the property page

Add a class to hold the MEF metadata describing the embedded XAML `Rule`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.Properties;

namespace MyNamespace
{
    internal static class RuleExporter
    {
        [ExportPropertyXamlRuleDefinition(
            xamlResourceAssemblyName: "<Assembly Name>, Version=<Assembly Version>, Culture=<Assembly Culture>, PublicKeyToken=<Assembly Public Key Token>",
            xamlResourceStreamName: "XamlRuleToCode:MyLaunchProfile.xaml",
            context: PropertyPageContexts.Project)]
        [AppliesTo("MyUniqueProjectCapability")]
        [Order(orderPrecedence: 0)]
        public static int MyLaunchProfileRule;
    }
}
```

Important points:
- The `MyLaunchProfileRule` field itself is never used; it exists solely as a place to park the relevant attributes.
- The `xamlResourceAssemblyName` parameter is the fully-qualified name of the assembly holding the embedded .xaml file.
- The `xamlResourceStreamName` parameter specifies the name of the embedded resource. This will be of the form "XamlRuleToCode:<XAMl file name>".
- The `context` parameter should always be `PropertyPageContexts.Project`.
- The `AppliesTo` attribute is required. The `Rule` will only be available to projects with the matching capability.
- The `Order` attribute is also required. Generally an `orderPrecedence` of "0" is fine as there are limited situations where you would want to have multiple exports with the same `xamlResourceAssemblyName` and `xamlResourceStreamName` and so the order won't matter. Generally this would only be done to override the other metadata, such as the `AppliesTo` attribute, on an existing `ExportPropertyXamlRuleDefinitionAttribute`.

### Step 7: Add the assembly as MEF asset

Using the VSIX Manifest designer, ensure the assembly containing the embedded file is included as a "MefComponent" asset.

### Step 8: Add the assembly to the VS binding path

In order for Visual Studio to properly load the embedded `Rule` it needs to be able to load the containing assembly. This requires that the assembly be on the Visual Studio _binding path_. A full discussion of binding paths is beyond the scope of this document, but this is often accomplished by tagging the class defining your VS package with the `ProvideBindingPath` attribute, e.g.:

```csharp
[ProvideBindingPath]
[PackageRegistration(UseManagedResourcesOnly = true, AllowsBackgroundLoading = true)]
[Guid(MyPackage.PackageGuidString)]
public sealed class MyPackage : AsyncPackage
{
    ...
}
```

And you're done. This Launch Profile UI will be available in any project with matching capabilities.

## Option 3: `IRuleObjectProvider`

_Note this option is only available starting in VS 2022 Update 1 (Dev17.1)._

In this option, `Rule` objects are defined in code and provided to the project system via MEF-exported implementations of the `IRuleObjectProvider` type. This will be an attractive option if you already have an assembly participating in the VS MEF composition, don't have a .props or .targets file to hold `PropertyPageSchema` items, or prefer to define your `Rule`s in code rather than XAML.

This is also the simplest option if you need to localize your launch profile, as you can read the localized text from .resx files or similar rather than translating the entire .xaml file and distributing the translations.

### Step 1: Add the Project System SDK

Use the NuGet Package Manager to add the Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.Sdk package package to your project.

### Step 2: Define the `IRuleObjectProvider`

Create a new class with the following contents:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.Build.Framework.XamlTypes;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.Properties;

namespace RuleObjectProviderDemo
{
    [ExportRuleObjectProvider(name: "MyRuleObjectProvider", context: "Project")]
    [AppliesTo("MyUniqueProjectCapability")]
    [Order(0)]
    public class MyRuleObjectProvider : IRuleObjectProvider
    {
        private Lazy<List<Rule>> rules = new Lazy<List<Rule>>(CreateRules);

        private static List<Rule> CreateRules()
        {
            Rule rule = new Rule();

            rule.BeginInit();

            rule.Name = "MyLaunchProfile";
            rule.Description = "Properties associated with launching and debugging a custom debug target.";
            rule.DisplayName = "My Custom Debug Target";
            rule.PageTemplate = "commandNameBasedDebugger";

            rule.Metadata["CommandName"] = "MyCustomDebugTarget";

            // KnownImageIds.ImageCatalogGuid
            rule.Metadata["ImageMonikerGuid"] = Guid.Parse("AE27A6B0-E345-4288-96DF-5EAF394EE369");

            // KnownImageIds.Execute
            rule.Metadata["ImageMonikerId"] = 1173;

            rule.DataSource = new DataSource
            {
                Persistence = "LaunchProfile",
                HasConfigurationCondition = false,
                ItemType = "LaunchProfile"
            };

            rule.Properties.Add(new StringProperty
            {
                Name = "ExecutablePath",
                DisplayName = "Executable",
                Description = "Path to the executable to run.",
                Subtype = "file"
            });

            rule.EndInit();

            List<Rule> rules = new List<Rule>();
            rules.Add(rule);

            return rules;
        }

        public IReadOnlyCollection<Rule> GetRules()
        {
            return this.rules.Value;
        }
    }
}

```

Important points:
- The `Rule.Name` must be unique.
- The `Rule.PageTemplate` property must have the value `"commandNameBasedDebugger"`.
- The `Rule.Metadata` dictionary must include a value for `CommandName`: this is the debug command name (also known as a debug target) corresponding to this UI. Debug commands and how they are handled by VS are beyond the scope of this document.
- The `ImageMonikerGuid` and `ImageMonikerId` in `Rule.Metadata` together define an ImageMoniker designating the icon to show for this Launch Profile UI. These are optional and if they are not defined a default icon will be supplied.
- The `Rule.DataSource` property must be specified as shown above.
  - The `ItemType` property indicates that this `Rule` only pertains to launch profiles, as opposed to other types of items that are typically found in a project (`Compile`, `Reference`, etc.).
  - The `Persistence` property indicates that values for the properties should be read and written through the launch profile persistence mechanism, as opposed to trying to read data from the MSBuild file.
- The `ExportRuleObjectProvider` attribute exposes the class through MEF and allows the project system to find it.
  - The `name` parameter must be unique to this `IRuleObjectProvider`. Duplicate names will cause one or the other to be ignored.
  - The `context` paraemter should always be "Project".
- The `AppliesTo` attribute is required. The `Rule` will only be available to projects with the matching capability.
- The `Order` attribute is also required. Generally an `orderPrecedence` of "0" is fine, unless you are going to return a `Rule` object that extends an existing `Rule` from a different `IRuleObjectProvider`. In that case the `Order` of your `IRuleObjectProvider` must be higher than the other one.
- The set of `Rule` objects and the `Rule`s themselves should not depend on any VS state. That is, _do not_ dynamically generate different sets of `Rule`s, properties, etc., in the `GetRules` method based on the state of your project or any VS setting. They should be static in the same way that `Rule`s loaded from .xaml files are static.
  - Exception: It is fine for user-facing strings to vary based on the VS locale settings, as the locale cannot change while VS is running.
- `CreateRules` must handle concurrent access, hence the use of `System.Lazy` in the example above.

### Step 3: Add the assembly as MEF asset

Using the VSIX Manifest designer, ensure the assembly containing your `IRuleObjectProvider` implementation is included as a "MefComponent" asset.

And you're done. This Launch Profile UI will be available in any project with matching capabilities.
