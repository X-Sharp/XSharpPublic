  <Accelerator>
    <summary>
      Create an accelerator table.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Many applications use accelerators as keyboard equivalents for menu selections. An accelerator is a keystroke sequence that is associated with a particular menu command—the accelerator is used to execute the menu command without requiring the application user to first display the menu and then choose the command.
      For example, if the File New command had an accelerator of Ctrl+N, you could simply press this key combination to open a new document, rather than having to choose the File menu and then the New command.
      Each window can be given its own accelerator using the Window:Accelerator property. An accelerator generates events as though its associated menu command was actually selected. Note that an accelerator's menu command does not even have to be visible on any menu—thus an accelerator can be seen as a direct keystroke sequence for generating a command event.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example demonstrates the use of the Accelerator class:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD Init() CLASS MyTopAppWindow
        SUPER:Init()
        SELF:Show()
        SELF:Accelerator := Accelerator{IDA_HOTKEYS}
      </code>

      In Windows, an accelerator object is created using the ACCELERATORS statement in the resource entity. For example, the following defines three accelerator keys: "^X" for the Exit menu command, "Ctrl+Insert" for the Copy menu command, and "Shift+Insert" for the Paste menu command.
      <code language="X#">
        RESOURCE IDA_HOTKEYS ACCELERATORS
        BEGIN
        ^X, IDMI_EXIT
        VK_INSERT, IDMI_COPY, VIRTKEY, CONTROL
        VK_INSERT, IDMI_PASTE, VIRTKEY, SHIFT
        END
      </code>
    </example>
  </Accelerator>
  <Accelerator.ctor>
    <summary>
      Load an accelerator table from a resource entity.
    </summary>
    <param name="xResourceID">The resource ID of the accelerator table, or another accelerator object, whose accelerators are copied.</param>
    <remarks>
      When no parameter is passed, X# will create a dynamic accelerator. If another accelerator is passed in X# will copy its table of accelerator keys.
      The creation of the actual Windows accelerator is delayed until the Accelerator is first used.
    </remarks>
  </Accelerator.ctor>

      This method can be used when an Accelerator object is no longer needed. Accelerator:Destroy() de-instantiates the Accelerator object and allows you to close and free any resources that were opened or created by the object, without waiting for the garbage collector.

    <remarks>
      This method provides a handle to the Windows GDI object, which can then be used by Windows API GDI calls.
      When the Accelerator objects is 'dynamic' this will create the actual Windows GDI Object and no more accelerators can be added to the accelerator

  <ActiveXControl>
    <summary>
      Base class for ActiveX control objects.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The ActiveXControl class serves as the base class for ActiveX controls developed in X#. The main class representing the ActiveX control has to be derived from this class.
      <note type="tip">When creating ActiveX controls in the IDE, the class derived from ActiveXControl has to be specified in the OCX Base edit control on the OLE Server tab page in the Application Options dialog box.</note>
    </remarks>
  </ActiveXControl>
  <ActiveXControl.ctor>
    <summary>

      Init()is automatically called by the ActiveX container. Normally, it should not be called from your application code.
    </summary>
    <param name="hObject">A handle (pointer) representing the object.</param>
    <remarks>
      This method instantiates an ActiveXControl object. Unlike other Init() methods, ActiveXControl:Init() should never be called from X#application code directly. Instead, it is called by the ActiveX container, which creates the ActiveX object.
      For further details, see Creating OLE Servers in X# in the "How To" section of the online help, as well as the sample applications that are accessible from the Samples tab page of the Application Gallery.
    </remarks>

  <ActiveXControl.Create>
    <summary>
      Create an ActiveX control.
      Create()is automatically called by the ActiveX container. Normally, it should not be called from your application code.
    </summary>
    <param name="hParent">The window handle of the parent (container) window.</param>
    <remarks>
      The Create() method is called after the ActiveXControl object is instantiated. Note that the both methods are called from the ActiveX container application: they should never be called directly from your code.
      Inside Create(), you should:
      1.	Instantiate a control or window object representing the user interface of the ActiveX control. This object should be assigned to OCXWindow.
      2.	Instantiate an object representing the automation interface of the ActiveX control and assign it to AutoServer.
      3.	Instantiate an object representing the event interface of the ActiveX control and assign it to Events—this step is optional.
      4.	Perform other initializations tasks.

  <ActiveXEvents>
    <summary>
      Base class for classes implementing the event interface of ActiveX server applications.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      ActiveXEvents serves as a base class for classes implementing the event interface of ActiveX server applications. The class implementing the application's event interface should be derived from ActiveXEvents, and it has to be specified on the OLE Server tab page in the Application Options dialog box when specifying your application's options.
      The methods of the event class are included in the server's type library and, at the same time, can be used by the server to fire an event by calling the FIREEVENT macro.
    </remarks>
  </ActiveXEvents>
  <ActiveXEvents.FireEvent>
    <summary>
      FireEvent() should never be called directly. Use the FIREEVENT UDC instead.
    </summary>
    <param name="iEventID">The event ID.</param>
    <param name="nPCount">The number of parameters.</param>
    <param name="pStack">A stack pointer.</param>
    <remarks>
      The FireEvent() method should never be called directly. Instead, the FIREEVENT macro (contained in OCX.UDC ) should be used to call this method with the correct parameters.
      Usually the methods of an event class are empty except for a FIREEVENT call. This way, the methods are used both to set up the server's type library and for firing the event in the server code.

    <remarks>
      The Create() method creates the underlying window control for controls not loaded from a resource (i.e., designed with the Window Editor) but created at runtime. Normally, it is not necessary to call Create() directly—CA-X# will create the object internally as soon as a window handle is needed.

  <App>
    <summary>
      Create an entity that represents the overall application. Please note that you have to create a subclass of App in your code and add a Start() method to this class. You can't add a Start() method to the App() class inside GUI Classes like you can in VO.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The App class starts, runs, and stops the application. However, nearly all the code in an application executes in event handlers.
      Once you invoke the method App:Exec(), the system starts sending you events.
      While the term application is consistent in both the windowing and non-windowing worlds, the event-driven nature of a windowing application is designed to handle user-driven events (such as a mouse click or the resizing of a window). As a result, the function of the windowing application is relegated to an event scheduling loop.
      In this class, the Start() method is analogous to the entry point START() function in CA-Clipper. It is where the main elements of your application are constructed. The objects declared within App:Start() should be those which have "application wide" scope.
      Within the App:Start() method you must call App:Exec(). Doing so invokes the message processing loop of your underlying windowing system and begins the system event handling mechanism by activating the system dispatcher.
      The App:Exec() method can be thought of as a layered service with a typical "get-translate-dispatch-message" mechanism driven by your underlying windowing system and a "filter-translate-dispatch-event" mechanism being directed through the system framework by the system dispatcher.
      The App:Quit() method provides a way of breaking out of the application's Exec() loop to terminate the application. It is analogous to the QUIT() function in CA-Clipper.

      The following example demonstrates an entire application, using the various methods of the App class:

      A window that is registered as an OLE drop target using AppWindow:EnableOLEDropTarget() can handle OLE drag and drop events and create new OLE objects in response to such events. In the associated handlers, an OLEDragEvent object is passed as a parameter that can be used to create a new OLE object by calling OLEObject:CreateFromOLEDragEvent().
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code enables a data window as a drop target and creates a new OLE object inside its OLEDrop handler. It also checks the name of the OLE object to allow only WordPad documents:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD EnableOLEDropTarget CLASS DropTargetDataWindow

    <summary>
      Start the event handling loop for the non-GUI application.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Normally, the event handling loop for the application continues looping until there are no more EventContext objects. It can also terminate upon calling ASPAppAbstract:Quit().
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code shows the framework for an out-of-process ASP component application:

  <AutoServer>
    <summary>
      Base class for implementing an OLE automation server.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The AutoServer class can be used as the base class for implementing OLE automation servers. You can use any X# class as the automation interface; however, if you decide to let your automation server inherit from AutoServer, you do not have to perform the registration calls, RegisterOLEAutomationObject() and UnregisterOLEAutomationObject().
      For further details, see Creating OLE Servers in X# in the "How To" section of the online help, as well as the sample applications that are accessible from the Samples tab page of the Application Gallery.
    </remarks>

    <param name="lASP">
      A flag specifying if the automation server is to be used as an ASP component. The default is TRUE, if <paramref name="oOwnerWnd" /> is a descendant of the ASPAppAbstract class; otherwise, FALSE.
    </param>
    <remarks>
      The Init() method instantiates a new automation Server object.
      <note type="tip">When creating OLE automation server applications in the IDE, you have to set the application properties on the OLE Server tab page in the Application Options dialog box to match the ProgID and class of your automation server.</note>
    </remarks>

  <AutoServer.CloseServer>
    <summary>
      Close the server application.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      If a X# class representing an Automation Server implements a CloseServer() method, this method is called whenever the reference count of the server reaches 0, i.e., when the last client closes the connection to the server. The default implementation in the AutoServer class is to terminate the server application.
    </remarks>
  </AutoServer.CloseServer>

  <AutoServer.HelpAbout>
    <summary>
      Displays a "help about" message box.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      An automation server usually offers a HelpAbout() method. In this base class, the HelpAbout() method displays a simple message box. In derived classes, however, you will probably want to override the method for specialized automation servers.

  <BaseListBox>
    <summary>
      Provide the base class from which all X# list boxes are subclassed.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      List boxes display a list of strings (or items) to the user. You can use the methods of BaseListBox to add, arrange, remove, and interrogate the items in a list box. You can also specify how the items in a list box should be sorted.
      When an item in a list box is single- or double-clicked, the event handlers Window:ListBoxClick() and Window:ListBoxSelect() are triggered in the list box's owner window, respectively.

  <CheckBox>
    <summary>
      Create check boxes, which are controls that can be toggled on or off by a user (or for 3-state check boxes, to a third state).
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      A check box allows the user to choose between 2 or 3 states.
      A 2-state check box allows a choice between a checked (ON) and unchecked (OFF) state.
      The choice is reflected in CheckBox:Value access, which may be TRUE or FALSE.
      A 3-state check box adds a third (UNDETERMINED) state, in which the box is dimmed.
      The third state is indicated by CheckBox:Value being TRUE and by CheckBox:ValueChanged (which is normally TRUE) being FALSE.
      A check box may be bound to a logical field in a server.
      Because of this, you can not directly bind a 3-state check box to a server; instead you must create a
      numeric or character field to store the 3-state information, and update it based on the status of
      the CheckBox:Value and CheckBox:ValueChanged accesses.

      The Window:ButtonClick() event handler responds to events in the check box. The default behavior of the event handler is to toggle the state of the check box. Typically, you would implement your own ButtonClick() event handler in which you first call the default handler to set the state of the buttons. For example:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD ButtonClick(oControlEvent) CLASS MyWind
        SUPER:ButtonClick(oControlEvent)
        // Do something else
      </code>
    </remarks>
    <example>
      This example creates a check box on a dialog window and then checks it:
      <code language="X#">
        CLASS MyDialog INHERIT DialogWindow
        HIDDEN oCBNew AS OBJECT
        METHOD Init(oWindow,nResourceID) CLASS MyDialog
        SUPER:Init(oWindow,nResourceID)
        oCBNew := CheckBox{SELF,IDB_CHECKBOX}
        oCBNew:Checked := TRUE
        SELF:Show()
      </code>

      In Windows, check boxes are equivalent to a button with the BS_CHECKBOX style. The style BS_AUTOCHECKBOX is useful because the button is automatically checked and unchecked without any code being written in the system. They are normally specified in the resource entity like this:
      <code language="X#">
        RESOURCE IDD_ABOUT DIALOG 20,20,160,120
        STYLE WS_POPUP | WS_DLGFRAME
        BEGIN
        CHECKBOX "&amp;Color" IDB_COLOR,10,20,40,12
        CHECKBOX "&amp;Filled" IDB_FILLED,10,35,40,12
        CONTROL "&amp;Auto",IDB_AUTO,"button", BS_AUTOCHECKBOX,10,65,40,12
        DEFPUSHBUTTON "OK" IDB_OK,64,80,32,14, WS_GROUP

  <ChildAppWindow>
    <summary>
      Create child application windows.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      A child application window is an application window that "belongs to" another window (its owner). Because a child application window is not independent of the owner window, it is always destroyed, hidden, or iconized when its owner window is destroyed, hidden, or iconized. Also note that child application windows are clipped against the owner window.
      Child application windows do not have a default size and position on their owner window. They must be given an origin and size before they are shown.

      In Windows, a child application window never displays a menu (except for the system menu). However, it can own a menu. If the child window is used as an MDI child under a shell window, its menu is displayed in the shell.
      This is very useful: when different child windows present different types of data, they often need different menus. The system automatically switches the owner shell window's menu according to which child window has focus.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example displays a child window:
      <code language="X#">
        CLASS MyTopAppWindow INHERIT TopAppWindow
        HIDDEN oCAWNew AS OBJECT
        METHOD Init() CLASS MyTopAppWindow

    <remarks>
      A window that is registered as an OLE drop target using ChildAppWindow:EnableOLEDropTarget() can handle OLE drag and drop events and create new OLE objects in response to such events. In the associated handlers, an OLEDragEvent object is passed as a parameter that can be used to create a new OLE object by calling OLEObject:CreateFromOLEDragEvent().
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code enables a data window as a drop target and creates a new OLE object inside its OLEDrop handler. It also checks the name of the OLE object to allow only WordPad documents:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD EnableOLEDropTarget CLASS DropTargetDataWindow
        SUPER:EnableOLEDropTarget(TRUE)
        METHOD OLEDrop(oOLEDragEvent) CLASS MyChild
        LOCAL oOLE AS OLEObject
        LOCAL lRet AS LOGIC
        IF oOLEDragEvent:ObjectName == "WordPad Document"

  <ComboBox>
    <summary>
      Create a combo box, which is used when you need to provide the user with both a list of choices and an edit control (to optionally allow them to type in their own choice).
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      A combo box (also known as a combination box) is a control that combines the abilities of an edit control and a list box. There are three types of combo boxes—simple, drop-down, and drop-down list.
      A combo box displays a list of items or choices to the user, as well as allowing text to be entered directly into an edit area. The combo box methods will allow you to add, arrange, remove, and interrogate the list of items.
      When one of the items is selected, ComboBox:CurrentItem, ComboBox:CurrentItemNo, ComboBox:TextValue, and ComboBox:Value are updated. Either a one-dimensional or two-dimensional array is specified in the FillUsing() method, with a row for each of the items available for selection. With a two-dimensional array, the first element is called the display value, and the second element is called the return value. When an item is selected, the ComboBox:TextValue contains the first element (the display value), and ComboBox:Value contains the second element (the return value). When text is directly entered, ComboBox:CurrentItemNo is set to 0 and the new text is stored in ComboBox:TextValue and ComboBox:Value.
      A combo box may be bound to a field (character, date, logical, numeric, or memo) in a server. The field's data value is stored in ComboBox:Value. The combo box compares the data value to the second element values specified in the FillUsing() array, and if a match is found, the first element (the display value) is stored in ComboBox:TextValue. In a "no-match" situation, the combo box shows no item selected, ComboBox:CurrentItem is NULL_STRING, ComboBox:CurrentItemNo is set to 0, and ComboBox:TextValue and ComboBox:Value reflect the field contents. If an item is selected, ComboBox:CurrentItemNo is set to a number between 1 and ComboBox:ItemCount, and the corresponding second element is stored as ComboBox:Value and as the field's data value. If text is directly entered, it will also be stored as the field's data value.

      Use the Window:ListBoxSelect() event handler to respond to selections, and the Window:ListBoxClick() event handler to respond to choices.
      A combo box is primarily a selection device, so there is no special support for the functionality available in the Edit class. However, the contents of the edit component can be changed or obtained using the inherited CurrentText access/assign methods.
      The combo box also generates EditFocusChangeEvents when its edit control loses or receives the focus.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      This example creates a combo box and fills it with a list of animals:
      <code language="X#">
        CLASS MyWindow INHERIT TopAppWindow
        HIDDEN oCB AS OBJECT
        METHOD Init() CLASS MyWindow
        SUPER:Init()
        oCB := ComboBox{SELF,42,Point{10,10},;
        Dimension{100,40},BOXDROPDOWN}
        oCB:AddItem("Pig")
        oCB:AddItem("Cow")
        oCB:AddItem("Horse")
        oCB:Show()
      </code>
      This example creates a combo box with different currencies, showing an explicit representation to the user but using a different representation internally:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD Init(...) CLASS OrderWindow
        ...
        oCBCurrency := ComboBox{SELF,CBCURRENCY_ID}
        oCBCurrency:FillUsing({;
        {"U.S. Dollars","USD"},;
        {"Can. Dollars","CDN"},;
        {"Mexican Pesos","MEX"},;
        {"Yen","YEN"},;
        {"British Pounds","UK"},;
        {"German Marks","DM"};
        })
        oCBCurrency:Show()
      </code>
      This example creates a combo box that shows the products available in the product table:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD Init(...) CLASS OrderWindow
        ...
        oCBProducts := ComboBox{SELF,CBPRODUCTS_ID}
        oCBProducts:FillUsing(oDBProducts,#ProdName,#ProdNo)
        oCBProducts:Show()

    <remrks>
      <note type="tip">ComboBox:Value may not always be consistent with what the state of the control, as indicated to the end-user. For example, if the data value for the field is not one of the allowed choices for a list box return value, the control will be in a "no-match" situation. In this case the list box will revert to its initial unselected state with CurrentItemNo set to 0.</note>
      If there is no selected item and the combo box is not bound to a field in a server, the ComboBox:Value is set to NIL. If there is a match, the ComboBox:Value assign also changes ComboBox:CurrentItem, ComboBox:CurrentItemNo, ComboBox:TextValue, and ComboBox:ValueChanged. If the assigned text does not match one of the return value choices, ComboBox:CurrentItemNo is set to 0, and TextValue and Value are set to the assigned text. In a list box, the ComboBox:Value is generally one of the return values, unless the control is bound to a field where the actual contents is not one of the allowable choices; in this case, ComboBox:TextValue and ComboBox:Value contain the field's data value.
      The data type for ComboBox:Value is determined by the field specification of the list box; in turn, controls linked to a data server inherit the field specification—and hence data type—from the field of the server. When the control is made data-aware, by setting its name to the name of a field in the server attached to the data window, ComboBox:Value is able to automatically read from and write to this field.

      A ComboBoxEx control is a ComboBox control with two extensions.
      Firstly, each item in the list is able to display an image beside it. This is achieved with the use of an ImageList object that is assigned to the control. It is also able to overlay a second image when the item is selected. Both images are specified when the item is added to the control.
      Secondly, unlike the normal ComboBox control, a ComboBoxEx control is not restricted inside of the frame of its owner but, can pass over the frame and into the surrounding area so as to display its list of entries in the drop-down box.

  <Control>
    <summary>
      Provide the base class from which all X# controls are subclassed.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Control is the base class for a major system class hierarchy. Controls provide an easy mechanism for user I/O. They are self-contained and notify their respective owners when the user takes some action (such as pressing a button or entering text).
      Controls on dialog windows created from resource entity templates are shown automatically when the dialog window is shown. However, if the application wishes to manipulate a control, it must register the control by creating a system object of the appropriate type.
      Controls must appear in an owner window. They also need to know where to appear. There are two basic ways you can specify where; one is by placing the control using the Window Editor. In this case, X# generates a resource to represent the control. When you construct the control in your program, you pass to the constructor the ID of the resource as its second argument. The other way is to place the controls dynamically, in which case, you pass the position and size of the control as the third and fourth arguments (the first argument is always the owner and the second argument is always the resource ID). Even when you place the control dynamically, you pass in a unique ID as the second argument.
    </remarks>

    <remarks>
      <note type="tip">Consult your Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit documentation for detailed information about a particular Windows API constant.</note>
      Controls are created in one of two ways: dynamically or from a compiled dialog resource. Dynamic creation, which requires that size and position be specified as instantiation parameters, can be used on any type of window. A compiled dialog resource (which specifies both size and location of the control) can be used only with data windows and dialog windows.
      Additionally, the default state when a control is created depends on the way you placed the control:
      With dynamic creation, the control remains invisible until you invoke Control:Show().
      This allows the program to set up the control correctly (with the correct size, position, and any other parameters), while avoiding the "visual noise" of changing controls.
      With resource-bound instantiation, the control is automatically shown, without requiring a call to Control:Show().

  <Control.Activate>
    <summary>
      Provide a method that is invoked when the control has focus and a window is activated.<br /><br />

    <seealso cref="T:VO.Event" />
    <remarks>
      <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/Callback/*" />
      The Activate() event occurs at the start of the control's lifetime or when the control is activated after it has been deactivated (for example, by clicking on it with the mouse). The newly active control receives the input focus.

      You should create and show cursors (if needed) in this event handler method.
      Any subclass with its own Activate() and Deactivate() event handlers should always call its owner's handlers. This ensures that the caption bars get highlighted or dimmed accordingly.
    </remarks>
  </Control.Activate>
  <Control.AsString>
    <summary>
      Return the contents of the control (or its identifying label).
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      For controls that have values, such as edit controls and check boxes, this method returns the same as Control:TextValue. For controls that do not have values, such as push buttons, it returns the same as Control:Caption. In either case, Control:AsString() presents the control as a recognizable string.
    </remarks>

    <value>A string representing the caption of the control (i.e., the static text identifying the control)</value>
    <remarks>
      A string representing the caption of the control (i.e., the static text identifying the control). Examples include the label on the face of a button, the text written next to a check box or radio button, or the text on the border of a radio button group or group box.
      Note that not all controls have a visible caption. For example, the ordinary edit control (MultiLineEdit class) does not have a visible caption—the text commonly displayed next to the edit is actually a separate control, placed there by the Window Editor. Thus, assigning a new value to the caption of this type of control does not change anything on the screen.

      Provide a method to de-instantiate any Control object.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      This method can be used when a Control object is no longer needed. Control:Destroy() de-instantiates the Control object and allows you to close and free any resources that were opened or created by the object, without waiting for the garbage collector.

  <Control.Disable>
    <summary>
      Disable a control (until a subsequent call to Control:Enable()).
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Disabled controls are not active (for example, push buttons cannot be clicked and data controls cannot be modified) and, therefore, they do not send events to their owner windows. Note that under Windows, a disabled control is dimmed.

    <returns>
      A numeric value representing the event handler to handle the event.
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/Callback/*" />
      Controls receive events from the user and the system all of the time. Each control receives only the events that are relevant to it. For each event that is generated, two things happen:
      1.	The event is converted to a particular Event object (an ExposeEvent or a MouseEvent, for example) according to the action that triggered the event.
      2.	The appropriate event handler is called, and this typed Event object is passed to it.
      <note type="tip">
        If you want to set a specific return value for the underlying window procedure, you have to change the EventReturnValue variable for the control object.
        If you want to handle other events (for example, timer events), you need to write your own Dispatch() method.
        The following guidelines should be followed when writing a customized Dispatch() method:
        1.	Subclass an event type appropriate to the type of operation for which it is being used.
        2.	Add an event handler function to your derived object. (This event handler should be called with the event when the event is received.)
        3.	In general, the implementation of this event handler should call Default(). This keeps the same behavior as the base class, but it also allows other classes to provide useful event handlers for your new type of event, allowing you to provide a framework for other classes to use.
        The base class Dispatch() method should be called in those cases where the received event is not handled by the customized dispatcher. For example:
        <code language="X#">
          RETURN SUPER:Dispatch(<paramref name="oEvent" />)
        </code>

  <Control.Enable>
    <summary>
      Enable a control that was previously disabled.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Enabling a control allows it to generate events and to send the events to its owner window when the user manipulates the control. The dimming of disabled controls is removed, and the control is restored to its normal appearance.
      By default, controls are enabled until disabled, so there is no need to call this Enable() method unless Control:Disable() was previously called.

    <remarks>
      <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/Callback/*" />

        <item>The control should retain enough information to redraw the screen as it was (or as it should be).</item>

      An ExposeEvent is also triggered by calling Repaint() or Update(); you should not call Repaint() or Update() during the Expose().

    <remarks>
      Control:LinkDF() should ordinarily not be called directly by the application. It is called by the DataWindow:Use() method; Use() connects an entire client to an entire server. You can use Control:LinkDF() to link a control to a data field explicitly, perhaps if the control's name doesn't match the data field's name so the automatic linkage of the Use() method doesn't work.
      It is even possible to use Control:LinkDF() to link individual controls to different servers; however, this is not recommended, because none of the automatic behavior of the data window and none of its cooperation with the data server applies to more than one server. Notifications are not to be received for servers other than the main server that the window is registered with, and actions such as DataWindow:Delete() and DataWindow:Append() apply to the main server. To link a window to more than one database, use the techniques described in the "GUI Classes" chapter of the Programmer's Guide.

        Whenever one of these assigns is called, the current size and position of the control or window is saved to an internal array. The assign can be called as
        often as is required without any difficulty and it will simply over right the old values.

  <Control.Show>
    <summary>
      Display a control so it is visible.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The default state when a control is created depends on the way you placed the control:
      With dynamic creation, the control remains invisible until you invoke Control:Show().
      This allows the program to set up the control correctly (with the correct size, position,
      and any other parameters), while avoiding the "visual noise" of changing controls.
      With resource-bound instantiation, the control is automatically shown, without requiring a call to Control:Show().
      Control:Show() is also usually called to redisplay a control that was hidden with the Control:Hide() method.
    </remarks>

    <value>A hyperlabel indicating the status of the control after a validation attempt or other action.</value>
    <remarks>
      If the validation passed or the operation was successful, this value is NULL_OBJECT; if not, it contains information about the failure, which can be retrieved and displayed—for example:
      <code language="X#">
        IF !oControl:FieldSpec:Validate(x)
        WarningBox{SELF, oControl:Status:Caption,;
        oControl:Status:Description}:Show()
        ENDIF
      </code>
      Hyperlabels are commonly used in the system, and in this case, the warning box is capable of accepting a hyperlabel and extracting the relevant information from it. Thus, this example can be simplified even further:
      <code language="X#">
        IF !oControl:FieldSpec:Validate(x)
        WarningBox{SELF,oControl:Status}:Show()

    <remarks>
      This method suspends all drawing updates for a control. It is especially useful for TreeView and ListView controls, where you typically want to suspend drawing while the ListView or TreeView control is filled.

    <value>A string representing the value held in the control.</value>
    <remarks>
      For example, in a standard edit control, the value can be "Jones" or "$14,683.00". In a check box, the value can be "TRUE" or "FALSE". For push buttons, Control:TextValue is set to NULL_STRING. In a list box or combo box, Control:TextValue holds the display value text. In a radio button group, Control:TextValue holds the caption text of the radio button that is currently selected.
      Note that the string is formatted according to the picture clause held in the field specification of the control; in turn, controls linked to a data server inherit the field specification - and hence picture clause - from the field of the server.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following examples demonstrate the use of the Control:TextValue property:
      <code language="X#">
        // Prints "C" for character string
        ?ValType(oDCAmountControl:TextValue)
        // Access the control (string value)
        cAmount := oDCAmountControl:TextValue

    </summary>
    <value>The value held in the control, in whatever data type the control holds.</value>
    <remarks>
      The value held in the control, in whatever data type the control holds. Control:Value is thus of the usual data type. For example, in a regular edit control, the value can be the string "Jones" or the number 14683. In a check box, Control:Value can be TRUE or FALSE. In a list box or combo box, the Control:Value is generally one of the return values (unless the control is bound to a field where the actual contents is not one of the allowable choices). In a radio button group, Control:Value holds the group value (specified in the Window Editor) of the radio button that is currently selected; if none is selected, Control:Value is set to NIL.
      The data type of the control's Value is determined by its field specification; in turn, controls linked to a data server inherit the field specification—and hence data type—from the field of the server. When the control is made data-aware, by setting its name to the name of a field in the server attached to the data window, Control:Value is able to automatically read from and write to this field.
      <note type="tip">Value may not always be consistent with the state of the control, as indicated to the end-user. For example, if the data value for the field is not one of the allowed choices for a list box or combo box return value, or among the group value settings for the radio buttons in a radio button group, the control will be in a "no-match" situation. In this case the control will revert to its initial unselected state.</note>
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following examples demonstrate the use of the Control:Value property:
      <code language="X#">
        // Prints "N" for numeric
        ?ValType(oDCAmountControl:Value)
        // Access the control (numeric value)
        nAmount := oDCAmountControl:Value
        // Assign 5 to the control
        oDCAmountControl:Value := 5

    <value>A logical value representing whether the control's Value has been changed from its prior setting.</value>
    <remarks>
      A logical value representing whether the control's Value has been changed from its prior setting. TRUE indicates that it has been changed from its prior setting, while FALSE indicates it has not. The Control:ValueChanged access is especially useful when the control is bound to a field in a server, since it is reset to FALSE each time you move to a new record. It is set to TRUE if you have changed from the original data value.

      Many controls generate notification events, which are sent to their parent window so that the parent window can take some action. The notification is sent to the parent in the form of the ControlNotify event handler. This event is often subclassed so that a control can send an event object that is specific to the control and the notification. In this case, a more specific event handler in the parent is called as well.

      The notification code for this event as defined by the Windows API. The value of the notification code depends on the type of control and the event. Refer to your Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit documentation for more details.
      <note type="tip">
        The ControlNotifyEvent:NotifyCode access returns a DWORD variable.
        NotifyCode Values in the Windows SDK are usually defines as:
        <code language="X#">
          DEFINE TVN_KEYDOWN       := (TVN_FIRST-12)
          DEFINE TVN_FIRST        := (0U-400U)
        </code>
        In prior versions of X# TVN_KEYDOWN compiled to a LONG with value -412. Most other development environments treat defines like these as DWORD (unsigned) because the TVN_FIRST has one or more unsigned constants in its definition.
        Unfortunately there is a small problem in X#:
        USUAL variables can only contain LONG or FLOAT numerics and not DWORDS.
        This means that if you call ControlNotifyEvent:NotifyCode late bound you will receive a USUAL and therefore a LONG.
        So in case the NotifyCode is TVN_KEYDOWN, then the USUAL will have a LONG value of -412.
        We therefore strongly advise to store Event objects in a type local. This ensures that you will get the correct numeric type:
        <code language="X#">
          METHOD ControlNotify(oControlNotifyEvent) CLASS HelpAbout

  <ControlWindow>
    <summary>
      Create a control as part of the Window hierarchy, thereby allowing the behavior of the control to be customized using event handlers.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      When a control is created as part of the Window hierarchy, it can trap events. For example, you might want to customize the appearance of controls (like changing the background and foreground colors) or modify their default key handling.
      Manipulating a control via the ControlWindow class requires more overhead than those created by the subclasses of Control. Therefore, it is recommended that control windows be used only where special handling is needed (for example, to override the handling of certain events or call some window method on a control).

    <value>A number between 1 and 8000 representing the unique ID of the control on which the control window is based.</value>
    <remarks>
      A number between 1 and 8000 representing the unique ID of the control on which the control window is based. Every control has its own unique ID to distinguish it from other controls (enabling the owner window to determine which control generated an event).

  <ControlWindow.Destroy>
    <summary>
      Free memory resources allocated for a ControlWindow object and its derived objects.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      This method immediately frees resources for ControlWindow objects created explicitly in your application. ControlWindow:Destroy() also takes care of resources allocated to derived classes and deallocates them in the necessary order.
    </remarks>
  </ControlWindow.Destroy>
  <ControlWindow.Disable>
    <summary>
      Disable a control window, including its associated control (until a subsequent call to ControlWindow:Enable()).
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Disabled controls are not active (for example, push buttons cannot be clicked and data controls cannot be modified) and, therefore, they do not send events to their owner windows. Note that under Windows, a disabled control is dimmed.
    </remarks>
  </ControlWindow.Disable>

  </ControlWindow.Dispatch>
  <ControlWindow.Enable>
    <summary>
      Enable a control window that was previously disabled.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Enabling a control window allows it to generate events and to send the events to its owner window when the user manipulates the control window. The dimming of disabled control windows is removed, and the control window is restored to its normal appearance.
      By default, control windows are enabled until disabled, so there is no need to call this Enable() method unless ControlWindow:Disable() was previously called.
    </remarks>
  </ControlWindow.Enable>

  <Cursor>
    <summary>
      Create a text cursor, which is used to visually represent the position in a window where the next piece of text appears.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The default cursor is an I-beam, although you can also create cursors using bitmaps.
      Note that a window can have only one cursor at a time. The system automatically manages the cursor between windows.
      <note type="tip">
        Not applicable for DialogWindows or DataWindows.
        Tip: In X#, the Cursor class corresponds to a text cursor; use class Pointer to create mouse cursors.
      </note>
    </remarks>
    <example>
      This example creates a cursor during a focus change:
      <code language="X#">

  </Cursor.ctor>
  <Cursor.Destroy>
    <summary>
      Provide a method to de-instantiate a Cursor object.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      This method can be used when a Cursor object is no longer needed. Cursor:Destroy() de-instantiates the Cursor object and allows you to close and free any resources that were opened or created by the object, without waiting for the garbage collector.
    </remarks>
  </Cursor.Destroy>
  <Cursor.Handle>
    <summary>
      Return the handle for a cursor.
    </summary>
    <param name="nHandleType">

    </param>
    <returns>
      A handle describing the underlying system object.
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      This method provides a handle to the Windows GDI object, which can then be used by Windows API GDI calls.
    </remarks>
  </Cursor.Handle>
  <Cursor.Hide>
    <summary>
      Hide a cursor so it is not visible (until a subsequent call to Cursor:Show()).

  <Cursor.Show>
    <summary>
      Display a cursor so it is visible.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      You must always Show() cursors explicitly. Cursor:Show() is also usually called to redisplay a cursor that was hidden with the Cursor:Hide() method.
    </remarks>
  </Cursor.Show>
  <CustomControl>
    <summary>
      Provide a base custom control class from which to derive specialized custom controls.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The CustomControl class registers its own Window class and can be used as a base for custom and owner-drawn controls. The CustomControl class is available via the Window Editor's tool palette.
      A custom control is an empty child window that can be used as a control on any window surface. The plain custom control does not have any built-in functionality, so you usually want to derive your own custom control class and implement specific behavior.
      Also, since a custom control only implements an empty child window, you should implement your own Expose() handler to support the owner-drawn surface of the control.

  <DataBrowser>
    <summary>
      Create a data browser, which is a spreadsheet-like table for displaying information from a data server.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      A data browser is a control, like a check box or edit field. However, it should ordinarily not be created as an independent control; the easiest way to use a data browser is to switch a data window to browse view. This creates the DataBrowser object; it may be referenced through the data window's Browser property.
      The data browser is data-aware, like a window, and may be connected to a data server as a client. It exhibits much of the same behavior as a data window: it propagates data down to the server and it responds to all the notification messages that a server sends to its clients.
      The easiest way to place a browser on a window as a control together with other controls is to place another data window as a nested subform; see the DataWindow class for a description. This is easily done in the Window Editor using the Edit Insert menu commands or the Auto Layout feature. See "Using the Window Editor" in your IDE User Guide for details.
      <note type="tip">Static dependencies to the CATO3*.DLL files, which contain the DataBrowser and SplitWindow functionality, have been removed in this version of X#. Applications not using a data browser and/or split window no longer need these .DLLs. This leads to a smaller memory footprint, faster application startup, and smaller installations.</note>

      Data browsers present information in a spreadsheet-like table, with rows and columns.
      The columns are DataColumn objects. Data columns correspond to fields in a data server—each data column is linked to a server field (just like data controls on a data window).
      The rows correspond to records in the server. Unlike a regular data window, which displays only one record—the "current" record—at a time, the browser displays several records as rows in the table. It always maintains one row as the "current" row, which is the record the server is positioned on. References to the data and action methods that manipulate the data always refer to the "current" record, just like in a regular data window. The only difference, therefore, is visual, in that the browser shows records other than the current one.

      The user and the developer have a great deal of flexibility in the visual layout of data browsers. Columns can be resized and rearranged on the fly, by the user with the mouse (unless the developer disables these options) or under program control.
      To retain meaningful control of a column's contents after it has been rearranged, columns are identified by their name. If there is a need to use numbers for reference (as in a generic utility program that knows nothing of the meaning of its data), the columns can be referenced by their original positional number in the browser, which may or may not be the same as their visual position.

    <param name="nIndex">The column after which the new column or columns will be inserted. This value can be a string or symbol representing the name of the column, a number representing its column number, or an oDataColumn object identifying the column. If you specify a number, you should note that column numbering begins at 1 (which refers to the first column in the logical sequence, not necessarily the leftmost column from the visual viewpoint). If omitted, new columns are added after the last column.</param>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      When columns are inserted in the middle of the sequence, the reference numbers for any trailing columns are incremented. This is one reason why columns should be referenced by name, rather than number. Also, note that while columns can be repositioned from a visual viewpoint, they retain their logical position in the browser.
    </remarks>
  </DataBrowser.AddColumn>

    <value>A string representing the caption of the data browser for use in its title bar.</value>
    <remarks>
      A string representing the caption of the data browser for use in its title bar. By default, the data browser uses the caption defined in its hyperlabel.
      Assigning a blank caption (" ") causes the title bar to be displayed with no text. Assigning a NULL_STRING causes the title bar to be hidden. Note that by embedding newline (Chr(10)) characters in the caption string, the title bar changes height to accommodate multiple lines.
    </remarks>
  </DataBrowser.Caption>
  <DataBrowser.CellDoubleClick>
    <summary>
      Provide an event handler, called when the user double-clicks in a cell in the data browser.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      As with all event handlers, this method is called automatically by the system. The developer can override this method to customize the response to this event: the standard response is to switch the cell into editing mode with the entire contents selected. In addition, the cells allow editing immediately, accepting the first keystroke as the new cell contents.
    </remarks>
  </DataBrowser.CellDoubleClick>

      The background color can be set for different parts of the data browser as a whole, but not for individual columns. To set the background brush for individual columns, use DataColumn:ChangeBackground().
      As a rule, initial settings are picked up from the standard settings of the environment—under Windows, colors are set in the Control Panel. Note that while it is possible to alter the color of the caption and column caption areas, this is not recommended when a 3-dimensional, sculpted, "button look" is used—end users can be confused if buttons don't look like buttons.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      To set the background of the text area to yellow and highlighted text to blue:

      The text color can be set for different parts of the data browser as a whole, but not for individual columns. To set the color for individual columns, use DataColumn:ChangeTextColor().
      As a rule, initial settings are picked up from the standard settings of the environment—under Windows, colors are set in the Control Panel.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      To set the text color in the main area to blue and highlighted text to red:
      <code language="X#">

    </example>
  </DataBrowser.ChangeTextColor>
  <DataBrowser.Clear>
    <summary>
      If one or more cells in the data browser are selected, clear their contents; if only some characters in a cell are selected, remove only those characters.

      The current selection can be a few characters in a cell, an entire cell's contents, several cells, several records, or nothing at all.
      <note type="tip">Clear() is not allowed if more than one record is selected.</note>
      Note that this method changes the fields to which this data browser's cells are linked and, therefore, the changes are subject to validation. The operation leaves the cells blank, but required fields or other validation rules can mark the record as invalid.
      The operation performed by this method is the same action as is normally performed in standard GUI applications by the Edit Clear menu command (note that under Windows, this menu command is typically linked to the Delete key). This standard behavior is automatically provided by X# and, therefore, there is no need to provide a special method for this (in fact, the Delete key works even if there is no menu command). Systems like spreadsheets (which provide both clear and delete operations) link the Delete key to the Edit Clear menu command, not to the Edit Delete menu command.
      <note type="tip">Do not confuse clearing with deleting. Clearing a structure (such as a cell or field) removes its contents. Deleting a structure, on the other hand, removes the actual structure.</note>

    <param name="lHasFocus">TRUE indicates the column is gaining focus; FALSE indicates the column is losing focus.</param>
    <remarks>
      When column focus is changed (i.e., the user moves from one column to another), typically there will be two events generated, thus ColumnFocusChange() will be called twice. The first event will be for the previous column losing focus and the second event will be for the new column gaining focus. You can trap either event by checking the value of <paramref name="lHasFocus" />.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code demonstrates how the ColumnFocusChange handler can be used:
      <code language="X#">

      The current selection can be a few characters in a cell, an entire cell's contents, several cells, several records, or nothing at all. If several cells are selected, they are copied to the clipboard in the standard tab-separated format accepted by spreadsheet and word processor products.
      The operation performed by this method is the same action as is normally performed in standard GUI applications by the Edit Copy menu command (note that under Windows, this menu command is typically linked to the Ctrl+C and/or Ctrl+Insert accelerators).

  <DataBrowser.Default>
    <inheritdoc />
  </DataBrowser.Default>
  <DataBrowser.Destroy>
    <summary>
      Provide a method to de-instantiate a DataBrowser object.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      This method can be used when a DataBrowser object is no longer needed. DataBrowser:Destroy() de-instantiates the DataBrowser object and allows you to close and free any resources that were opened or created by the object, without waiting for the garbage collector.
    </remarks>
  </DataBrowser.Destroy>
  <DataBrowser.Disable>
    <summary>
      Disable a data browser (until a subsequent call to DataBrowser:Enable()).
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Disabled data browsers are not active and, therefore, they do not send events to their owner windows or receive input focus. Note that a disabled data browser is dimmed.

    <value>The edit font for the DataBrowser. This font can be changed with the ChangeFont() method.</value>
  </DataBrowser.EditFont>
  <DataBrowser.Enable>
    <summary>
      Enable a data browser that was previously disabled.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Enabling a data browser allows it to generate events and to send the events to its owner window when the user manipulates the data browser. It also allows the data browser to receive input focus. The dimming of disabled data browsers is removed, and the data browser is restored to its normal appearance.
      By default, data browsers are enabled until disabled, so there is no need to call this Enable() method unless DataBrowser:Disable() was previously called.
    </remarks>
  </DataBrowser.Enable>
  <DataBrowser.EnableBorder>
    <summary>
      Specify the border style of the data browser.
    </summary>
    <param name="kBorderType">
      The display style of the data browser window's border, specified as one of the constants in the table below
    </param>
    <remarks>
      <code>
        Values for kBorderType
        Constant	Description
        BTNOBORDER	No border.
        BTNONSIZINGBORDER	A single-line border that does not allow resizing.
        BTSIZINGBORDER	A border that allows resizing. This is the default.
      </code>
      When autosizing is enabled for a data browser acting as a browse view for a data window, the data browser should not have a border because the window provides a sizing border. When a data browser is acting as a regular control, a non-sizing border is most commonly used.
    </remarks>
  </DataBrowser.EnableBorder>
  <DataBrowser.EnableColumnMove>
    <summary>
      Enable/disable whether the user can move (rearrange) columns in the data browser with the mouse. If this method is not called, the ability to move columns is enabled, by default.
    </summary>
    <param name="lAllowMove">TRUE allows column movement; FALSE disables it. The default is TRUE.</param>
    <remarks>
      The user can rearrange the columns by simply dragging a column's caption area with the mouse. For the purpose of reference from the program, the columns retain their original numbering, regardless of the visual position.
      Column movement is enabled/disabled at two levels: the DataBrowser class level and the DataColumn class level. If column movement is set at the browser level, DataBrowser:EnableColumnMove() can be used to enable/disable movement. However, if column movement is enabled at the column level, this method can no longer be used.
      DataColumn:EnableColumnMove() must be used to change the setting.
    </remarks>
  </DataBrowser.EnableColumnMove>
  <DataBrowser.EnableColumnReSize>
    <summary>
      Enable/disable whether the user can resize columns in the data browser with the mouse. If this method is not called, the ability to resize columns is enabled, by default.
    </summary>
    <param name="lAllowResize">TRUE allows column resizing; FALSE disables it. The default is TRUE.</param>
    <remarks>
      The user can resize the columns by dragging on the boundary between the column caption areas with the mouse.
      Column movement is enabled/disabled at two levels: the DataBrowser class level and the DataColumn class level.
      If column resizing is set at the browser level, DataBrowser:EnableColumnResize() can be used to enable/disable resizing. However, if column resizing is enabled at the column level, this method can no longer be used. DataColumn:EnableColumnResize() must be used to change the setting.
    </remarks>
  </DataBrowser.EnableColumnReSize>
  <DataBrowser.EnableColumnTitles>
    <summary>
      Turn column titles on or off for the entire browser.
    </summary>
    <param name="lEnable">TRUE shows column titles; FALSE hides them. The default is TRUE. </param>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      This method has been introduced to replace the functionality of calling DataColumn:SetCaption with a NIL argument, which is documented as removing the caption area from the column. Since column caption areas cannot be removed from single columns, it must be done globally for the entire browser.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example illustrates how DataBrowser:EnableColumnTitles may be used to suppress the display of column titles in a subform browser created via Window Editor-generated source code:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD Init( oOwner ) CLASS DW_Detail_DataBrowser
        SUPER:Init( oOwner )
        SELF:EnableColumnTitles( FALSE )

      If not specified, the initial splitbar position defaults to GBSSBMIDDLE.
    </param>
    <remarks>
      <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/SplitBar/*" />
      A vertical splitbar allows the left and right parts of a window to be independently scrollable sideways. The position of the splitbar in the window is also adjustable with the mouse.

  <DataBrowser.Paste>
    <summary>
      Paste the current contents of the clipboard into the current data browser cell.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      How clipboard data is pasted into the data browser depends on the following:
      The current selection

      The current selection can be a few characters in a cell, an entire cell's contents, several cells, several records, or nothing at all.

      If a few characters or an entire cell is selected, the selected characters are overwritten with the pasted data. Note that in this case, the standard tab-separated format accepted by spreadsheet and word processor products is used, as long as the shape of the selection matches.

      If nothing is selected, the clipboard data is inserted into the current cell (i.e., the one containing the cursor). Note that the data is inserted before the cursor.

      <note type="tip">Paste() is not allowed if more than one record is selected.</note>

      The Insert key
      Note that this method changes the fields to which this data browser's cells are linked and, therefore, the changes are subject to validation. The operation leaves the cells blank, but required fields or other validation rules can mark the record as invalid.
      The operation performed by this method is the same action as is normally performed in standard GUI applications by the Edit Paste menu command (note that under Windows, this menu command is typically linked to the Ctrl+V and/or Shift+Insert accelerators). This standard behavior is automatically provided by X# and, therefore, there is no need to provide a special method for this (in fact, the accelerators work even if there is no menu command).

    <remarks>
      When a column is deleted, the reference numbers for any trailing columns are decremented. This is one reason why columns should be referenced by name, rather than number.

  <DataBrowser.RestoreUpdate>
    <summary>
      Update this data browser visually and restore standard operation (after DataBrowser:SuspendUpdate() is called).

      DataBrowser:SuspendUpdate() is used to reduce "visual noise" during a multi-record update of the data browser from its data server. When the updating is complete, use the DataBrowser:RestoreUpdate() method to refresh the display and reactivate standard behavior.
      Note that DataBrowser:SuspendUpdate() stacks its invocations. Therefore, for each call to DataBrowser:SuspendUpdate(), there needs to be a corresponding call DataBrowser:RestoreUpdate().

      When a data browser is first shown, its connected data server can be traversed to build up its buffer of records. When the data browser traverses the server, it uses the current server cursor location to get its first record. It is up to the application to position the server prior to using it with a data browser.

      This method is used to reduce "visual noise" during a multi-record update of the data browser from its data server. For example, when reading a full screen of data, the appearance of the window is more pleasing if the screen updates occur all together. When the updating is complete, use the DataBrowser:RestoreUpdate() method to refresh the display and reactivate standard behavior.

    <remarks>
      <note type="tip">If the browser is used as a browse view of a data window, there is no reason to use this method; the browser is automatically connected to the server of the window it belongs to.</note>
      The DataBrowser:Use() method connects browser columns with fields of the data server based on matching names. Any column that does not have an explicitly provided field specification and hyperlabel inherits the FieldSpec and HyperLabel objects from its data server field.
      If the data browser does not have any columns, the DataBrowser:Use() method automatically creates a layout with columns for all the fields in the server.
      DataBrowser:Use() also registers the data browser as a client of the server with the DataServer:RegisterClient() method.

    <example>
      This example sets the code block for a calculated Wages column where HoursWorked and HourlyRate are fields in your database. These lines would appear inside your DataBrowser:Init() method:

    <remarks>
      A string representing the caption of this data column for use in its caption area. By default, the data column uses the caption defined in its hyperlabel.
      You can specify a caption in a manner similar to the DataBrowser:Caption property (for example, assigning a blank caption ("") causes the caption area to be displayed with no text). Note that the height of the caption area is automatically made large enough to accommodate the captions of all columns in the owning data browser.

    <remarks>
      The setting specified here supersedes, for this data column, the setting set in this data column's owner data browser. Although the button and caption area can be specified, the method refers only to this column.
      As a rule, initial settings are picked up from the standard settings of the environment—under Windows, colors are set in the Control Panel. Note that while it is possible to alter the color of the caption and column caption areas, this is not recommended when a 3-dimensional, sculpted, "button look" is used—end users can be confused if buttons don't look like buttons.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      To set the background of the text area yellow and column caption blue:
      <code language="X#">
        oDataColumn:ChangeBackground(Brush{Color{COLORYELLOW}},	GBLTEXT)

    <remarks>
      DataColumn:LinkDF() should ordinarily not be called directly by the application. It is called by DataBrowser:Use(); Use() connects an entire client to an entire server. You can use DataColumn:LinkDF() to link a column to a data field explicitly, perhaps if the column's name doesn't match the data field's name so the automatic linkage of DataBrowser:Use() doesn't work.
      It is even possible to use DataColumn:LinkDF() to link individual columns to different servers; however, this is not recommended, because none of the automatic behavior of the data window and none of its cooperation with the data server applies to more than one server. Notifications will not be received for servers other than the main server that the window is registered with, and actions such as DataWindow:Delete() and DataWindow:Append() apply to the main server. To link a window to more than one database, use the techniques described in the "GUI Classes" chapter of the Programmer's Guide.

      Whereas a regular data window is an MDI child window, a data dialog window behaves like a modal dialog window. This means that the user must respond to the window and close it before continuing with the application and that the data dialog window is not resizable.
      The main purpose of this class is to provide a way to create a window for small data entry tasks, such as password entry.
      Note that because the DataDialog class uses DialogWindow (rather than a ChildAppWindow) internally, AppWindow:EnableVerticalScroll() and AppWindow:EnableHorizontalScroll() are just stubs—they do not do anything.

  <DataListView>
    <summary>
      Create a data list view as a faster, read-only, standalone control and an alternative to a data browser.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      A data list view is a "data-ware" list view control which serves as a fast, read-only alternative to a data browser. Together with the list view column control, a data list view can be used inside the Window Editor to "paint" the browse view portion of a data window. It can also be used as a standalone control.
      The DataListView control uses internally a virtual list view, which means that its speed is independent of the total number of records in your database. Additionally, the scrollbar size and position always represents the position in the database correctly.
      The DataListView control relies on the OrderKeyCount(), OrderKeyGoto(), and OrderKeyNo() methods of the associated server. If there is no active order, the DataListView control uses RecCount(), GoTo(), and RecNo() instead. Additionally, the DataListView control has some limitations, depending on the currently active RDD:
      SetFilter is supported for NTX and CDX drivers only.
      SetDeleted(TRUE) is not supported for all RDDs.
      If you want to hide all deleted records, you should use SetDeleted(FALSE) and specify a data server filter condition like:
      <code language="X#">	SetFilter({|| !Deleted()}, "!Deleted()")</code>
      OrderScopes are supported for NTX and CDX drivers only.
      If you want to use a DataListView control as a replacement for a DataBrowser control, set the Browser Inherits From property in the Window Editor to DataListView. The generated code will then reference DataListView.
      <note type="tip">Choosing a DataListView control as a replacement for a DataBrowser control has an additional advantage: your applications will not need the CATO3xxx.DLL support DLLs.</note>
      The DataListView control can also be used as a standalone control that can be placed on any window or dialog. In this case, you have to explicitly assign a data server to the DataListView:Server property.

  <DataWindow>
    <summary>
      Create a data window which is capable of interacting intelligently with a data server.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Data windows combine the properties and behavior of both child windows and dialog windows, and add data-aware behavior that enables them to interact intelligently with data servers. When connected to a data server, a data window forms a view of the server that allows for direct access and manipulation of the server's data.

      Unlike the other types of windows, a data window takes on different behavior depending on how it is used. It adapts itself to the demands placed on it by its owner, behaving differently depending on the circumstances:
      If Owner Is	Data Window Acts Like
      ChildAppWindow	Modal DialogWindow
      DataWindow	Modal DialogWindow (if no placement is specified) or nested sub-data window (if placement is specified)
      DialogWindow	Modal DialogWindow
      ShellWindow	ChildAppWindow
      TopAppWindow	Modal DialogWindow

      A data window can be placed on a data window in an owner-child relationship (similar to other controls like check boxes and radio buttons). When a data window is placed on another data window in this way, it is referred to as a sub-data window. Note that only a data window can own a sub-data window because it is the only window type of window that can deal with data-related events.
      You can create a data window as a sub-data window when the data window is created. You can optionally specify a third parameter (<paramref name="nResourceID" />), indicating that the new data window should be created as a control on a window by giving its location and size. When placed like a control, the data window hides its border decoration and behaves like a sub-data window. (If this parameter is omitted, the data window is created as a modal DialogWindow, not a sub-data window.) See DataWindow:Init() for details.
      Tip: Instead of newly creating a data window, you may prefer to use the Window Editor's Auto Layout feature which—at the touch of a button—automatically creates controls for every available field in a data window's associated data server(s). See "Using the Window Editor" in the IDE User Guide.

      A data window is connected to a server with the Use() method. When this connection is established, each control on the window is connected to a field in the data server based on matching names: a field named CustName is connected to the control named CustName. The control always reflects the current value of the data in the data server, and assigning a value to a control automatically propagates it to the server.
      Data windows can be associated with data servers in two ways: in a single server or dual server (master detail) relationship.

      The Master-Detail option allows you to link a window to two data servers in a master-detail relationship. In this case, a data window is created for the master server with a nested sub-data window for the detail server.
      The field list presented is taken from the Master data server. The field that you choose is used to perform a SetSelectiveRelation() to the detail server based on its controlling order. If you do not choose a field, the detail window is updated relative to the current record position in the master window.

      A data window can take on two different view modes: form view, which contains individual controls for the data fields and browse view, which contains a spreadsheet-like data browser. The data window can be initially displayed in either mode, and can be switched to the other mode at any time (using the DataWindow:ViewAs() method). Any data window supports both appearances, although the developer can, of course, choose not to provide a way to select one mode or the other.
      The two view modes provide the same set of facilities: the same data linkage facilities, the same display options, the same data manipulation methods. From the perspective of the application, a data window has the same behavior and the same data properties regardless of view mode.

      The standard way of using a data window is to paint its layout in the Window Editor. This produces a resource entity that specifies what controls the window has, and their locations, sizes, captions, and accelerators. It also generates a data window subclass and an Init() method that associates names and further annotation with each control. With such a predefined layout, the window is displayed very quickly and the methods of the window have enough information to act intelligently.

      A data window can also be created without a resource entity. In this case, the layout of controls on the window is automatically generated when the window is connected to a data server. After a layout is automatically generated, the window has exactly the same behavior that it has with a resource-based instantiation.
      If a data window is switched over to a new view mode, and the new mode has not been defined through a resource entity or programmatically, the data window automatically creates a layout based on the characteristics of the connected data server. The new layout picks up all information about fields and controls that is known to the other view; thus, if complex validation rules, prompts, and help have been specified for the individual controls in form view, the columns of the browse view inherit the same properties.

      When a control is connected to a field in a data server, a value entered into the control or assigned to the appropriate name from the program is automatically propagated to the server. Thus, after executing this statement:
      <code language="X#">oCustomerWindow:CustName := x</code>
      the CustName field in the server has the correct value.
      Values are propagated up from the data server to the data window when the server repositions itself, or when another window makes a change. This requires no special action: after executing a Skip() method or assigning a value to a field, every window connected to the server is automatically updated to reflect the change.

      Data entered by the user is automatically validated using the rules of the field specification attached to a control or column. (For more detail on the validation rules provided, see the FieldSpec class.) If data fails the validation test, the data window will not propagate invalid information down to the server or to other windows, nor will it take any action that requires writing the invalid value to the server.
      In addition to the field-specific validations, the system allows the specification of a ValidateRecord() method for the window as a whole, for the purpose of cross-field validation. This method, if provided, is called after all the fields have passed their individual validations.
      The data window also provides for registering controls that are subject to the validation status. Such registered controls are disabled whenever the window's validation status is bad.

      The data window class also provides action methods that correspond to the general capabilities of all data servers: GoTop(), GoTo(), GoBottom(), SkipNext(), SkipPrevious(), Append(), Delete(), and so on. The data window versions of these methods verify the validation status of the controls on the window. If everything is valid, the window invokes the corresponding method of the data server.

      The data window provides built-in facilities for concurrency control, automatically taking and releasing record locks as appropriate. Once the appropriate mode has been selected by assigning one of the available modes to DataWindow:ConcurrencyControl, record movements and changes use the concurrency control facilities of the data server to take and release locks. If taking a lock fails because another user controls the record, the data window action fails.

      Specifying this argument creates the new data window as a sub-data window on its owner data window
      (only data window owners can have sub-data windows). It should refer to a control defined in the
      resource entity of the owner data window.

      When executed successfully, the data server to which the new record was appended sends a NotifyAppend

      DataWindow:Append() can fail for many reasons (for example, data entered in the window fails validation,
      record locks failed because another user controls the data server, or access to the database failed for
      technical reasons). Use the DataWindow:Status property to determine the exact cause of the failure.
      You might also want to check the feasibility of the operation beforehand, using methods like DataWindow:StatusOK().

      A window's background brush is used by CanvasErase() and in handling Expose events. Assigning a new background brush has no effect until the data window (or portion of the data window) is redrawn.

      A data window does not necessarily need to own a particular data browser. If a data window has no browser and the application chooses to view it in browse mode, X# automatically creates a browser for the window, populating it with one column for each field in the server. The column headings are taken from the server, using the hyperlabels of its fields.

      Button click events are propagated to the data window's owner the same way as menu events.
      For an in-depth discussion on command event propagation, refer to the Programmer's Guide.
      You must supply the code to turn a radio button on (and all the other radio buttons off)

    <remarks>
      The "cancel" operation is very clear and easily understood and might be profitably used on
      data windows when they are created as MDI children (unconventional or not).
      Note that a user might be unclear on exactly what transactions are discarded.
      For example, if several records have been modified, the default implementation
      of DataWindow:Cancel() discards changes only to the current record.
      You might want to label the button or menu command something else or provide a more comprehensive implementation.
      <note type="tip">
        DataWindow:Cancel() disconnects itself from the data server using
        DataServer:UnregisterClient() and tells the server that it can close itself if it has no other registered clients.
        Explicitly forcing the server to close from a window is not recommended, since this can create future problems.
        Modifications to the application can attach other clients to the server, and any one window should not
        disable other windows.

      In data windows, relations are used to manage relationships between windows that are linked to the same data server.
      Clearing a relation removes the link between the windows; in actuality, it clears the relations set for the data server to which this and any other windows are connected. Relations are set using DataWindow:SetRelation() and DataWindow:SetSelectiveRelation().

      This method also makes the changes visible to other users on other machines on a network, as well as to other
      applications on the same machine. Prior to DataWindow:Commit(), the changes are guaranteed to be visible
      only to other data windows connected to the same server within the same application.
      DataWindow:Commit() can fail for many reasons, from a lack of capability in the server to lock conflicts to
      technical problems, such as network crashes. Use the DataServer:Status property to determine the exact cause of the failure.
      You should also note that there is no guarantee that changes which have not been committed can be rolled back.
      The rollback capabilities depend on the particular data server implementation (for example, SQLSelect can usually
      do it—depending on the particular SQL database in use—but DBServer cannot).

      Control:SetFocus() should not be called until another control has received the focus.
      In complex dialog windows that contain many edit controls, it makes sense to grab the edit
      control's text when the focus is changing so that other controls can be updated with it if necessary.
      See the ButtonClick() method for an example of similar syntax to be used in this method.

Marked records are removed only when the file is packed, and until such time can be recalled. (With DBServer, the current setting of the SetDeleted() function affects whether deleted records are visible.) Changes that have been made to fields are recorded in the record before it is deleted; if the field is subsequently recalled, it correctly reflects any changes made before the delete operation.

      When executed successfully, the data server from which the record was deleted sends a NotifyDelete message to all of its clients, including this data window.
      This method checks validation status before allowing a delete operation. If the window contains invalid data, the user is asked if the data should be discarded or corrected before the delete operation is continued. If this behavior is not desired (perhaps because the application does not use recall or the window is to be used only with servers that do not support recall of deleted records), use DataWindow:Delete().
      With some servers (notably DBServer), a deleted record is not removed from the server but is simply marked as deleted. Marked records are removed only when the file is packed, and until such time can be recalled.

    <remarks>
      In data windows, controls (such as edit controls and check boxes) can be linked to the fields in the connected data server. Since the name of the control and the field are the same, FieldGet() can also be used to retrieve a control that is not connected to a server.

      If your data window uses cursors, you should hide the data window's cursor when the focus is changed to a different data window, and then show the cursor when the data window receives focus again. This should be used in conjunction with the Activate() and Deactivate() event handlers.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      This example demonstrates how FocusChange() displays the cursor at the specified cursor position when focus is gained. If the focus is lost, the cursor is hidden:

  <DataWindow.HelpRequest>
    <summary>
      Provide a method that is invoked when the user requests help from the application using one of the available context-sensitive help mechanisms.
    </summary>
    <param name="oHelpRequestEvent">The HelpRequestEvent object that describes which item help is being requested for.</param>
    <remarks>
      <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/Callback/*" />
      This event handler is invoked only if the help mechanism has been enabled for the current data window (or one of its owners). The help mechanism is enabled by assigning a HelpDisplay object to the windows HelpDisplay property.
      The default implementation of this event handler is to display the help topic that is associated with the control, menu command, or window region with focus when the HelpRequestEvent was generated. This is accomplished using HelpDisplay:Show(<paramref name="cKeyword" />), where <paramref name="cKeyword" /> is either a HyperLabel:HelpContext property or a default keyword generated by this event handler in cases where a hyperlabel is not available.
      If there is no hyperlabel for an item, the keyword generated is as follows:
      A HELPCONTROL request generates the keyword Control_xxxx, where xxxx is the numeric ID of the control, in decimal. For example, an OK push button might generate the keyword Control_101.
      A HELPMENU request generates the keyword Menu_xxxx, where xxxx is the "cleaned" text of the menu command. The cleaned text has all leading and trailing spaces and the ampersand character (&amp;) removed. In addition, all sequences of spaces are replaced by a single underscore, and the string is truncated at the first tab character.

      For example, the keyword generated for the menu command:
      Save &amp;As\tF3
      is
      Menu_Save_As
      A HELPWINDOW request generates one of the keywords listed in the table below, depending on the window region that has focus.
      Keyword	Window Region
      Window_Border	Border
      Window_Caption	Title bar
      Window_MaxBox	Maximize button
      Window_MinBox	Minimize button
      Window_SysMenuBox	System menu button
      Window_Unknown	Any area of the window not explicitly identified in this table
      Window_WindowCanvas	Canvas area

      <note type="tip">If the Window_Unknown keyword is generated, the default behavior of HelpRequest() is to display the Contents topic as defined in the HelpDisplay (that is, HelpDisplay:Show("HelpIndex")).</note>

      If a HELPWINDOW request is received, while DataWindow:HelpContext is defined, DataWindow:HelpRequest() uses the HelpContext property, regardless of the window region that has focus.
      Refer to the "GUI Classes" chapter in the Programmer's Guide for more information on programming an online help system for your application.

      This method checks the validation status of the window. If the data is valid and is correctly downloaded to the data server, it forces a commitment to the server and then closes the window.
      The "OK" operation is very clear and easily understood and might be profitably used on data windows used as MDI children (unconventional or not).
      Note that a user might be confused about exactly what information is accepted (for example, in a complex data window with nested windows). If there is any uncertainty, you might consider labeling a button or menu command with something more explicit.
      <note type="tip">DataWindow:OK() disconnects itself from the data server using DataServer:UnregisterClient() and tells the server that it can close itself if it has no other registered clients. Explicitly forcing the server to close from a window is not recommended, since this can create future problems. Modifications to the application can attach other clients to the server, and any one window should not disable other windows.</note>

    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/Callback/*" />
      This method provides some of the functionality of the WHEN clause in classical Xbase @...SAY...GET statements. However, since the GUI approach does not enforce a rigid sequence of data entry but allows the user to move from control to control at random, the logic of enabling and disabling controls must be different.
      Instead of checking a condition when focus switches into the control (this is too late, a user with a mouse is already on the new control), the system must keep checking on every significant event.
      DataWindow:Prevalidate() provides some automatic handling of this type of validation (through DataWindow:RegisterConditionalControls()), but it also allows you to insert custom logic by overriding the method.
      The standard action in DataWindow:Prevalidate() is to call DataWindow:EnableConditionalControls(); if problems exist, it calls DataWindow:DisableConditionalControls(). DataWindow:Prevalidate() is called after the application of the standard validation, allowing the user to replace the default handling, upon success or failure of validation.

      Conditional controls allow the developer to register several controls as subject to validation. This means that when the window fails validation, these controls are automatically disabled; when the window's status is OK, they are automatically enabled again.
      Controls that have been registered are automatically enabled or disabled—depending on validation status—by DataWindow:Prevalidate(), which is called on any status change in the window.
      In a practical data entry window, all the buttons would be registered and conditionally disabled—SkipNext, SkipPrevious, GoTop, GoBottom, Insert, Delete, OK—except for Cancel, which discards the invalid changes and hence should always be available.

    <param name="uRelativePosition">The number of records to be moved. Positive numbers more forward, negative numbers move backward. The default is +1.</param>
    <returns>
      TRUE if operation was successful; otherwise, FALSE. Skip() can fail for several different reasons. It can fail validation, there may not be that many records to move, the write that precedes the move can fail because of lock conflicts with other users that control the server, or the server can have become unavailable due to technical problems. Use DataWindow:Status to determine the reason for the failure.
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      This method is subject to validation (i.e., if the data in the window fails validation, the movement is refused).
      The method does not explicitly refresh the contents of the window after the move; this is done automatically by the NotifyRecordChange message that follows.
      Because it takes a numeric argument, the Skip() method is rarely connected directly with a push button or menu command: for simple movements, use the SkipNext() and SkipPrevious() methods. Skip() provides a lot of flexibility but is usually called from code, in methods of the data window.

      A hyperlabel identifying the status of this data window after the last operation. If the last operation was successful, this value is NULL_OBJECT; if something went wrong (whether it raised an error condition or merely returned a failure code), DataWindow:Status returns an informative hyperlabel.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following examples invoke several DataWindow:Status properties of the data server:
      <code language="X#">
        oDataWindow:Status:Caption

      StatusOK() scans all controls on the window for an invalid status. If an invalid control status is found, the method returns TRUE. Use the DataWindow:Status property to determine which control returned an invalid status.

  <DataWindow.UndoAll>
    <summary>
      Undo all changes made in this data window since the last record movement or Commit() operation.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      After a long series of changes to this record, the DataWindow:UndoAll() method restores the record to the values it had when it was originally accessed. However, the method does not provide for restoring changes made to several records; once the server has moved off a record, the changes are permanent as far as DataWindow:UndoAll() is concerned.
      If the data window is in "form" view, this applies to changes to the contents of the edit controls in the data window; if in "browse" view, this applies to the changes made to a row in the data browser.

  <DataWindow.UpdateActiveObject>
    <summary>

    </summary>
    <remarks>
      OLEDataWindow:UpdateActiveObject() calls the UpdateTools() method of any currently activated OLE object that the OLE data window contains. It first determines which OLE object control is in-place active, and then replaces the X# container application's toolbars with the OLE server's toolbars. In response to a resizing of the container application, this method causes the OLE object server to rearrange its toolbars.
    </remarks>

    <returns>
      TRUE if the connection was successful; otherwise, FALSE. The operation fails under the following conditions: if the window has controls and columns but none matches the names of the fields of the server and, of course, if there is a technical problem with the server.
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      The Use() method connects controls and browser columns with fields of the data server based on matching names. Any control that does not have an explicitly provided field specification and hyperlabel inherits the field specification and hyperlabel from its data server field.
      If the window does not have any controls or columns, the Use() method automatically creates a layout with controls or columns for all the fields in the server. A layout is created for each view—data window and browse—only when it is needed.
      Use() also registers the window as a client of the server with the DataServer:RegisterClient() method.
    </remarks>
  </DataWindow.Use>
  <DataWindow.ValidateRecord>
    <summary>
      If provided by the developer, ValidateRecord() is called by X# when you try to change records.
    </summary>
    <returns>
      TRUE if all fields in the current record are valid; otherwise, FALSE.
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      No default version of this method exists in the data window class. If a record-level validation method is provided, it should return a logical value indicating if the window is valid overall. If it returns FALSE, the method should set the window's Status property to a HyperLabel object with at least an appropriate description and possibly a help context tag, as well.
      ValidateRecord() can be used to perform cross-field validations, such as "the bonus can be no greater than half the salary and no greater than 10,000 for grades 6 and lower" and "tax filing information must be filled in if state is NY". While it is certainly possible to specify such validation rules for individual controls, and keep the controls independent of one another. This improves the reusability of code, making a control and its field specification usable regardless of what else is on the window.

      When a window is switched to a new view mode, a layout is automatically generated if one had not been defined previously.

  <DialogWindow>
    <summary>
      Create a dialog window (also commonly referred to as a dialog box), which allows the application and end user to interact. This type of dialog can be modal or modeless (see the description below).
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Dialog windows are windows that present a collection of controls for user I/O. They also have a result code that indicates the result of the user-dialog interaction (for example, if the user pressed the OK or Cancel push button in the dialog).
      Most windowing systems distinguish between modal and modeless objects. Modal objects must be acknowledged before the current thread of execution can continue; conversely, modeless objects do not affect the current execution thread.
      When a dialog box is modal, a further distinction must be made between system modal and application modal objects. Objects that are system modal must be acknowledged before any execution in any windows created by any currently running application, including the Windows desktop, can continue. Application modal objects, on the other hand, must be acknowledged before any execution in just the current application can continue (that is, the user can access windows created by other applications).
      By default, a dialog window is application modal. However, it can be made modeless by assigning FALSE to the <paramref name="lModal" /> flag in the DialogWindow:Init() method. You may also just want to create a modeless dialog box.
    </remarks>

    <remarks>
      <note type="tip">
        When creating windows without using the Window Editor there is a difference between the DialogWindow class and all other Window classes.
        With the other window classes it is possible to write code like this -
        <code language="X#">
          LOCAL oDW AS DataWindow
          oDW := DataWindow{ oOwner }
          oDW:Show( )
        </code>
        However, this code will not work -
        <code language="X#">
          LOCAL oDW AS DialogWindow
          oDW := DialogWindow{ oOwner }
          oDW:Show( )
        </code>
        It is possible to use a generated resource for a blank DialogWindow and inherit from this. The alternative is to do something like this -
        <code language="X#">
          oWin := DialogWindow{ oOwner, "IDD_DEFDLG2", TRUE }
          oWin:Size := Dimension{ 100 , 100 }
          oWin:Show( SHOWCENTERED )
        </code>
        Or
        <code language="X#">
          oWin := DialogWindow{ oOwner, "IDD_DEFDLG", FALSE }
          oWin:Size := Dimension{ 100 , 100 }
          oWin:Show( )
        </code>
        The difference between these two pieces of code is -
        <code language="X#">
          - The first uses the "IDD_DEFDLG2" resource ID and sets the modal property to TRUE. This will create a normal style dialog window and is known as a Pop-Up Dialog.
          - The second uses the "IDD_DEFDLG" resource ID and sets the modal property to FALSE. This is the style of dialog window that would be used as a Tab Page and is known as a Child Dialog.

      Button click events are propagated to the dialog window's owner the same way as MenuEvents. For an in-depth discussion on command event propagation, refer to the Programmer's Guide .
      You must supply the code to turn a radio button on (and all the other radio buttons off) when a user clicks on a radio button. Similarly, you must also be sure to invert the state of a check box when it is clicked.

    <remarks>
      If ControlFocusChange() is used to validate a control (and also set the focus to another control),
      Control:SetFocus() should not be called until another control has received the focus.
      In complex dialog windows that contain many edit controls, it makes sense to grab the edit
      control's text when the focus is changing so that other controls can be updated with it if necessary.
      See the ButtonClick() method for an example of similar syntax to be used in this method.
      Note that all controls are passed through this method, not only SingleLineEdit and MultiLineEdit controls.
      If looking to control Combobox selections, then the ListBoxSelect() callback method should be reviewed.

    <remarks>
      <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/Callback/*" />
      If DialogWindow:EditFocusChange() is used to validate an edit control (and also return the focus to it if invalid), Control:SetFocus() should not be called until another control has received the focus.
      In complex dialog windows that contain many edit controls, it makes sense to grab the edit control's text when the focus is changing so that other controls can be updated with it if necessary.

    <example>
      <note type="tip">This result code can then be passed to the routine that called the dialog window if the routine invokes DialogWindow:Result.</note>
      The following example instructs EndDialog() to return 0 if the Cancel push button is pressed and 1 if OK is pressed:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD ButtonClick(oEvent) CLASS MyDialogWindow
        IF oEvent:nControlID == ID_OK
        SELF:EndDialog(1)
        ENDIF
        IF oEvent:nControlID == ID_CANCEL

    </example>
  </DialogWindow.EndDialog>
  <DialogWindow.ExecModal>
    <summary>
      Allows the programmer greater control over Windows message handling in dialog windows.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Normally a dialog window will cause program execution to pause when the window is shown and then continue once the window is closed. The default behavior of ExecModal( ) maintains the expected behavior.
      However the programmer can create a new class which inherits from DialogWindow and implement a new ExecModal() method so as to change this behavior.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      As an example the programmer could use the following version which performs no action:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD ExecModal() CLASS DialogWindow
        RETURN NIL
      </code>
      Now the program control comes back immediately after calling the Show() method. This is very useful for cases where your code wants to control the windows dispatcher loop with the function ApplicationExec(EXECWHILEEVENT):
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD xyz() CLASS xyz
        LOCAL oPDlg AS ProgressDialog // inherit from DialogWindow

        oPDlg := ProgressDialog{SELF, "Processing is going on!"}
        oPDlg:Count := oServer:Reccount
        oPDlg:Show()

        //ProgressDialog is modal, the user can do
        // nothing during the processing other than what
        // your code permits.
        //In this example you can abort the loop.

        oServer:GoTop()

        DO WHILE oServer:EOF
        IF ! oPDlg:STEP() //FALSE if abort button is pressed
        EXIT
        ENDIF
        //do something
        oServer:Skip()
        ENDDO

  <DragDropClient>
    <summary>
      Create the client for use in a drag-and-drop operation.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      In Windows, "drag-and-drop" is a technique by which users can move files from one location to another, either visually (using the mouse) or through another system-accepted method. The client in a drag-and-drop operation is a utility object with an associated owner window that accepts dropped files.
      Creating a drag-and-drop client automatically makes its owner window capable of accepting drag-and-drop loads. The event handlers in the drag-and-drop client handle the events relevant to the drag-and-drop operation.
      <br />Important! When you call Window:EnableDragDropClient(TRUE), the window becomes a DragDropClient and inherits all the methods of DragDropClient. The callback methods DragLeave(), DragOver(), and Drop() are called on the Window object when a DragLeave, DragOver, or Drop event occurs (see the example below.)
    </remarks>
    <example>

      The system dispatches this method when, during an apparent drag-and-drop operation (that is, DragDropClient:DragOver() returns TRUE), the mouse leaves the client area of the window that owns the drag-and-drop client. This means that the user has thought better of performing the operation. Your implementation of DragLeave() should undo any actions taken during the drag-and-drop attempt, in case the user was simply en route to some other client.

      The system dispatches this method when, during a drag-and-drop operation, the mouse drags inside the client area of the drag-and-drop client. Several drag events can arrive at DragDropClient:DragOver() during the one operation, before the user finally drops the load or leaves the client area. Windows displays a special pointer to give the user visual feedback on the progress of the operation.

      The system dispatches this method when the user lets go of the mouse button to drop the load in the client area. This method is required to handle drag-and-drop correctly. It retrieves information about the load from the drag event and acts on each file in the selection.

  <DragDropServer>
    <summary>

    </summary>
    <remarks>
      In Windows, "drag-and-drop" is a technique by which users can move files from one location to another, either visually (using the mouse) or through another system-accepted method. The server in a drag-and-drop operation is the source of the drag-and-drop operation.
      The user normally uses the mouse to select a group of files to drag (however, the application can choose any reasonable metaphor for selection). After selection, the application creates a drag-and-drop load by storing the file names in an array; it then calls the DragDropServer:StartDrag() method.
      When you call Window:EnableDragDropServer(TRUE), the window becomes a DragDropServer. The DragDropServer is a property in the Window and is called Window:DragDropServer.

    </returns>
    <remarks>
      This method is called when the user starts the drag operation, usually by dragging the mouse. DragDropServer:StartDrag() is modal; once it is called, control is only returned to the program when the user has dropped the files.

    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Drag-and-drop is a GUI convention for moving objects from one place to another. In Windows, the convention only supports files. A drag event occurs when the user drags a group of previously selected files to a new location. Drag events occur in the target window where the selection will be dropped (not in the window where the selection was made).
      <note type="tip">Drag events do not occur in the drag-and-drop server (the source of the files)—only in the drag-and-drop client (the target). When the drag enters the client area, the drag event goes to the DragDropClient:DragOver() method of the client. If the drag leaves the client without dropping its files, and the drag-and-drop client has returned TRUE to the DragOver() method, a generic event goes to DragDropClient:DragLeave(). It is then no longer relevant or correct for the application to query the event if it is leaving the client. If the user drops the files, the drag event goes to DragDropClient:Drop().</note>

  <DrawObject>
    <summary>
      Provide the base class from which all X# DrawObject objects are subclassed.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The DrawObject class provides a protocol for drawable objects (for example, the Window class invokes DrawObject's methods to manage a drawable object). This protocol provides a means to maintain arrays of drawing objects for subsequent display on a window.
      Each object in the DrawObject hierarchy should provide both a BoundingBox property (to identify the smallest area that can enclose the drawing object) and a Draw() method (to specify how the object is to be drawn). When the application is finished with the object, it must be explicitly destroyed using the Destroy() method.

      Provide a method to de-instantiate a DrawObject object.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      DrawObject:Destroy() de-instantiates the DrawObject object and allows you to close and free any resources that were opened or created by the object, without waiting for the garbage collector. When the application is finished with the object, it must be explicitly destroyed using this method.
    </remarks>

      To display a DrawObject object, call Window:Draw() with the DrawObject object as its argument. The window does the drawing by asking each object to draw itself—for example:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD Expose(oEvent) CLASS MyWindow

  <Edit>
    <summary>
      Provide the base class from which all X# edit controls are subclassed.

      The Edit class provides simple text editing facilities for entering, deleting, and selecting text. In addition, you can specify if edit controls are to have a border, whether they should be read-only, or perhaps whether they should be password protected.
      Edit controls in this class hierarchy treat the text they contain as a series of numbered characters. In these edit controls, a selection is an ordered pair of character numbers. For example, if an edit control contains the text "samarkand," the selection (3,7) would select the text "mark."
      Also, for each control, the text limit is the maximum number of characters you wish the edit to hold.
      The non-graphic characters for newline (Chr(10)), tab (Chr(9)), and null (Chr(0)) occupy one character position.

    <remarks>
      When an edit control is created as part of the Window hierarchy, it can trap events. For example, you might want to customize the appearance of edit controls (like changing the background and foreground colors) or modify their default key handling.
      Manipulating a control via the ControlWindow class requires more overhead than those created by the subclasses of Control. Therefore, it is recommended that control windows be used only where special handling is needed (for example, to override the handling of certain events or call some window method on a control).

      The value held in the edit field in whatever data type the edit window holds. For example, the value can be the string "Jones" or the number 14683.
      The data type of the edit window is determined by its field specification; in turn, edit windows linked to a data server inherit the field specification—and hence data type—from the field of the server.
    </remarks>
  </EditWindow.Value>
  <EllipseObject>
    <summary>
      Create an EllipseObject object; this type of entity is part of the DrawObject hierarchy, which provides a means of displaying and manipulating various objects.
    </summary>
    <example>
      To draw an EllipseObject object, call Window:Draw() with the EllipseObject object as its argument. The window does the drawing by asking each object to draw itself—for example:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD Expose(oEvent) CLASS MyWindow
        LOCAL oEllipse AS OBJECT
        oEllipse := EllipseObject{Point{10,10},;
        Dimension{20,40}}

  <EllipseObject.Draw>
    <summary>
      Draw this EllipseObject object.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/Callback/*" />
      This method should not be invoked directly in the application code—it is invoked in X# by Window:Draw(). Refer to the EllipseObject class description for an example using the Draw() method.
    </remarks>
  </EllipseObject.Draw>
  <Error>
    <summary>
      Create an Error object, which contains information about runtime errors.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      An Error object is a simple object that contains information pertaining to a runtime error. Error objects have no methods, only exported instance variables.
      When a runtime error occurs, X# creates a new Error object and passes it as an argument to the error handler block specified with the ErrorBlock() function. Within the error handler, the Error object can then be queried to determine the nature of the error condition.
      Error objects can also be returned to the RECOVER statement of a BEGIN SEQUENCE construct with a BREAK statement. Similarly, Error objects are also be passed to error methods of DataServer or DataWindow objects. Here, the Error object can be queried for local error handling. For more detailed information and examples, see "Error and Exception Handling" in the Programmer's Guide.
    </remarks>
  </Error>
  <ErrorBox>
    <summary>
      Present the user with an error message box.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      An error message box is a window that contains the text "Error" in the title bar, the text of the message, and a warning icon.
      Error boxes are application modal—the user must acknowledge them before continuing with the application. When the error box closes, focus is returned to its owner window.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example creates and shows an error message box (whose owner is oMyWin) that displays the text "Oops, We have an error!" to the user:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD Start() CLASS App
        oMyWin := TopAppWindow{}
        oMyWin:Show()
        oErrBox := ErrorBox{oMyWin,;
        "Oops, We have an error!"}
        oErrBox:Show()
        SELF:Exec()
      </code>
    </example>
  </ErrorBox>
  <ErrorBox.ctor>
    <summary>
      Construct an error message box.
    </summary>
    <param name="uParent">The window that owns the error box. If no owner is specified, the error box is application modal (i.e., the application is suspended until the user acknowledges the error box).</param>
    <param name="uText">The description to be displayed in the error box. If no text is specified, the system-defined 'Error!' error message text is used.</param>

  <Event>
    <summary>
      Provide the base class from which all X# events are subclassed.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The system dispatcher dispatches events to the event handler in the appropriate window. The Event class always maps onto the GUI's event or message structure.
      Events are transient objects that carry information to windows indicating that a system event has occurred. For example, the information that a window has been uncovered is passed to that window's Expose() event handler as an Event object.

    </summary>
    <remarks>
      An explorer window is a two- or four-pane split window that mimics the functionality of Microsoft Windows application windows, such as File Manager or Explorer. The explorer window contains a list view control and a tree view control, as well as optional fixed text controls. The programming interfaces for these controls can be used directly to manipulate the window.
      A two-pane explorer window contains a list view and a tree view side-by-side, separated by a vertical split bar that can be dragged. A four-pane explorer window contains a list view and a tree view side-by-side, with fixed text that serves as a label above each. The list view and tree view are separated by a vertical split bar that can be dragged. The fixed text labels are separated from the list view and tree view by a horizontal split bar that cannot be dragged. Panes are aligned vertically.

  <ExposeEvent>
    <summary>
      Provide information about an ExposeEvent, used to notify a window that it may need to be repainted.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      An ExposeEvent occurs when a window is:
      First shown
      Moved or closed
      Moving or closing a window exposes the area underneath the window; if any other windows are in this newly exposed area, they need to be repainted. The system automatically sends these window(s) an ExposeEvent to notify them that they must repaint the area that was uncovered.
      Resized
      The ExposeEvent goes to the Window:Expose() event handler with the responsibility for repainting the exposed area. You should place your own code in this event handler if you want your application to do something when its window is exposed.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example prints different messages, depending on what part of the window has been exposed:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD Expose(oEE) CLASS MyWindow
        LOCAL oBB AS BOUNDINGBOX
        oBB := oEE:ExposedArea

    </value>
  </ExposeEvent.ExposedArea>
  <FixedBitmap>
    <summary>
      Create a FixedBitmap object. Unlike the bitmaps created by the Bitmap class, fixed bitmaps are static—they do not need to be redisplayed every time an ExposeEvent occurs. FixedBitmap objects can be created dynamically or from a resource entity.
    </summary>
    <example>
      This example creates a fixed bitmap from a resource entity and changes its position to the lower-left corner of a dialog window:
      <code language="X#">
        CLASS MyDialogWindow INHERIT DialogWindow
        HIDDEN OMyFBitmap AS OBJECT
        METHOD Init(oWindow) CLASS MyDialogWIndow
        SUPER:Init(oWindow,ID_MYDIALOG)

        OMyFBitmap:Origin := Point{10,10}
        SELF:Show()
      </code>

      In Windows, a fixed bitmap is equivalent to a static object with the SS_BITMAP style. These are normally specified in the resource entity as follows:
      <code language="X#">
        RESOURCE IDI_FIXEDBITMAP BITMAP fixed.bmp
        RESOURCE IDD_ABOUT DIALOG 20, 20, 160, 80

      In Windows, a fixed icon is equivalent to a static object with the SS_ICON style. These are normally specified in the resource entity as follows:
      <code language="X#">

  <FixedText>
    <summary>
      Create a FixedText object.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Unlike text displayed with Window:TextPrint(), fixed text from a FixedText object is static—they do not need to be redisplayed every time an ExposeEvent occurs. FixedText objects can be created dynamically or from a resource entity.
      <note type="tip">The text in a FixedText object can be changed by assigning TextControl:TextValue. In such a case, it may be necessary to resize the FixedText object because the size of the control dictates the clipping region for the displayed text.</note><note type="tip">
        As of Visual Obejcts version 2.7 the FixedText control supports the DrawText and Transparent options. These are on by default.
        If the old behaviour is required, set the EXPORTed variable lUseDrawText to FALSE. It is TRUE by default.
        If WinXP Themes are enabled and you want to stop the drawing of the theme behind the FixedText control, set the EXPORTed variable lDrawThemeBackground to FALSE. It is TRUE by default.
      </note>
    </remarks>
    <example>
      This example places some fixed text on a window:
      <code language="X#">
        CLASS MyWindow INHERIT TopAppWindow
        HIDDEN MyFT AS OBJECT
        METHOD Init() CLASS MyWindow
        p := Point{10,10}
        d := Dimension{10,10}
        MyFT:= FixedText{SELF,1,p,d,"The text"}
        SELF:Show()
        MyFT:Show()
      </code>

      In Windows, fixed text is equivalent to a static object with one of the SS_LEFT, SS_CENTER, SS_RIGHT styles.
      These are normally specified in the resource entity as follows:
      <code language="X#">

            Determines the width and height of the rectangle. If there are multiple lines of text,
            DrawText uses the width of the rectangle pointed to by the lpRect parameter and extends the base of the
            rectangle to bound the last line of text. If there is only one line of text,
            DrawText modifies the right side of the rectangle so that it bounds the last character in the line.
            In either case, DrawText returns the height of the formatted text but does not draw the text.

            Specifically, the average character width is calculated in the same manner as for an edit control,
            and the function does not display a partially visible last line.
            Replaces part of the given string with ellipses, if necessary, so that the result fits in the specified rectangle.
            The given string is not modified unless the DT_MODIFYSTRING flag is specified.You can specify DT_END_ELLIPSIS to
            replace characters at the end of the string, or DT_PATH_ELLIPSIS to replace characters in the middle of the string.
            If the string contains backslash (\) characters, DT_PATH_ELLIPSIS preserves as much as possible of the text after the last backslash.

            that follows, and the mnemonic-prefix characters &amp;&amp; as a directive to print a single &amp;.
            By specifying DT_NOPREFIX, this processing is turned off.

      Provide information about a FocusChangeEvent, used to indicate a change in window focus (i.e., gaining or losing focus).
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      When a window comes in or out of focus, the dispatcher generates a FocusChangeEvent and sends it to Window:FocusChange(). When the input focus changes, the window losing the focus gets a FocusChangeEvent (telling it that it is losing the focus) and the window gaining the focus receives a FocusChangeEvent (telling it that it is gaining the focus).
      A window that has focus gets KeyEvents when the user hits the keyboard. This is similar to an active window, but an active window receives MouseEvents instead of KeyEvents.
      Tip: Applications using cursors should use FocusChangeEvent to determine whether to create or destroy the cursor.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example locks the attached data server when the window gets focus:
      <code language="X#">

  <Font>
    <summary>
      Create a font, which describes how characters are displayed on a window.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      X# provides a set of predefined fonts, defined with the Font:Init() method. In addition, if desired, you can also create a font by specifying a particular size and style.)
      Although you supply specifics for a new font, the GUI actually picks an actual font which best fits the description provided.
      Each window has a currently selected font. Window:TextPrint() and Window:SizeText() use this font when they are printing or sizing text.
      <note type="tip">
        Deselecting a Font:	In Windows, the current font should be deselected before destroying the window. To do this, use Window:Font to assign the previous font, for example. However, this is only necessary if there is a font other than the default one currently selected.
        Font Pitch:	A font's pitch can be either variable or fixed. In variable pitch fonts, characters are proportionally spaced (for example, a variable pitch font uses more space to print an "M" than an "i"). In fixed pitch fonts, the same amount of space is used by each character, regardless of the character width. Fixed pitch fonts are most commonly used by terminals and typewriters or to display program text.
        Variable pitched fonts are not always supported. This is dependent on the individual font.
      </note>

      Defining what font you want is potentially complicated, for two reasons: different computers may have different sets of
      fonts installed and the same font may have different names on different computers. For
      example, the Helvetica font family which looks like this: Helvetica, is known as Helv, Helvetica, Arial, Swiss or MS Sans Serif,
      depending on what system you are using. The standard name for this font here is FontSwiss.
      To ensure that a program will work, regardless of what fonts are available on each computer, the Font class provides automatic methods
      for finding a reasonable match to the font you specify.
      In practice, however, as long as you use the most common names you will not have a problem since all versions of Windows
      contain the standard fonts.
      For example, to create a font of 10 pt Times New Roman and one of 8 pt Helvetica:
      <code language="X#">
        oFontRoman := Font{FONTROMAN10}	//
        oFontSwiss := Font{FONTSWISS8}		//
      </code>
      The system allows you to reference any font installed on the machine. For example, to create a font of 12 pt Palatino,
      <code language="X#">oMyFont := Font{,Dimension{12,12},"Palatino"}	// </code>
      Or a font of 16 pt Arial:
      <code language="X#">oMyFont := Font{, 16, "Arial"}  // </code>
      That approach, of course, is vulnerable to the font not being available. If Palatino is not available, the system would choose a reasonable facsimile, and if it had never heard of Palatino, this might not be a good match. To help the system come up with a reasonable match, you can specify what font family Palatino belongs to:
      <code language="X#">oMyFont := Font{FONTROMAN, Dimension{12,12},"Palatino"}</code>
      In this case, we would get Times Roman if Palatino was not available.
      You can specify the family only. For example, to create a 10 pt font in whatever is available in the script family:
      <code language="X#">oMyFont := Font{FONTSCRIPT,Dimension{10,10}}</code>

    <remarks>
      A group box is a single-line box with an appropriate title to identify the nature of the group. It should be drawn around the related controls on the surface of a window and can contain a single or several sets of choices.
      Use the Init() method from TextControl to create a group box. Also, the title of a group box can be changed using the TextValue assign method of TextControl.
      <note type="tip">
        CUA Style: According to CUA guidelines, you should not use group boxes for a set of one or more push buttons or list boxes. Rather, a group box would be more useful in a "Print File" dialog, for example, where a number of options—like a "Copies" edit control and a "Print Color" check box—can be grouped together.

  <HelpDisplay>
    <summary>
      Create a link to the help system in use.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The HelpDisplay class allows you to easily provide online help for your applications. The help system resource provided by the GUI can remain in memory until the HelpDisplay object is deleted. Therefore, before the application terminates, ensure that the HelpDisplay object is either deleted or goes out of scope.

      HelpDisplay provides a way to display help on a given topic. However, the application still needs a means of determining which topic help is required.
      For large applications, most GUI style guides recommend that help commands be made available from the menu bar. These commands can be trapped using the MenuCommandEvent handler, and the appropriate help information displayed in response.
      Another approach is to use push buttons to obtain help on specific topics. Using a push button and the ButtonClick() event handler, you can program the application to display the relevant help information when the Help button is pressed.
      In practice, an application's Help facility should combine menu commands and buttons to provide help.

      Context-sensitive help means the user receives help specific to the current activity when the help key or mouse sequence is chosen. For example, when responding to a dialog window, the user can want help for the control with the focus.
      X# applications can provide context-sensitive help for:
      Particular areas of the screen (such as the caption bar and canvas area)
      Menu commands
      Controls (like push buttons, edit controls, and toolbar buttons)
      To support a portable context-sensitive help system, X# provides the HelpRequestEvent class, the Window:HelpDisplay property, and the Window:HelpRequest() event handler method. (HelpRequest() determines the source of the help trigger—that is, the particular item for which help is requested—and passes this information on to the GUI's help system.)
      Refer to the "GUI Classes" chapter in the Programmer's Guide for more information on programming an online help system for your application.
      <note type="tip">
        The EXPORTed variable DefaultPageOnContents is a LOGIC which defaults to TRUE. It is used to determine whether the default page should be shown when HelpContents is requested. If set to FALSE, 'HelpContents' will display the Contents tab but leave the current topic displayed. For HTML Help only.

      On the other hand the Windows standard help cursor is full supported and the help button on a caption bar too. See: Window:EnableHelpButton() and Window:EnableHelpCursor()

  <HorizontalScrollBar>
    <summary>
      Create a horizontal scroll bar that is independent of its owner window.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      There are two types of horizontal scroll bars in X#: regular (created with CLASS HorizontalScrollBar) and window (created with the AppWindow:EnableHorizontalScroll() method).
      Both types have an owner window and can be manipulated using Window:HorizontalScroll(). However, a window horizontal scroll bar differs in that it automatically appears aligned along the bottom of its owner window's canvas area and also resizes itself according to the size of its owner window.
      A horizontal scroll bar allows the user to update a short integer numeric value by either moving the thumb position, clicking on the button at either end of the scroll bar to change the number by the designated ScrollBar:UnitSize, or by clicking in the interior of the scroll bar to change the number by the designated ScrollBar:BlockSize. The minimum and maximum allowable numeric values are indicated by the Min and Max values for the Range object associated with the scroll bar. The ScrollBar:Value access indicates the currently selected numeric value. A scroll bar may be bound to a numeric field in a server.
      <note type="tip">By default, Window:HorizontalScroll() updates the thumb position (the marker on the scroll bar that can be dragged up or down, left or right) in the scroll bar. If desired, you can change this by using your own implementation of this handler.</note>

      In Windows, horizontal scroll bars are equivalent to a scroll bar with the SBS_HORZ style. They are normally specified in the resource entity as follows:
      <code language="X#">
        RESOURCE IDD_ABOUT DIALOG 20, 20, 160, 120
        STYLE WS_POPUP | WS_DLGFRAME
        BEGIN
        CONTROL "", IDS_RED,  "scrollbar", SBS_HORZ, 10, 16, 100, 20
        CONTROL "", IDS_BLUE, "scrollbar", SBS_HORZ, 10, 46, 100, 20
        CONTROL "", IDS_GREEN, "scrollbar", SBS_HORZ, 10, 76, 100, 20

      The Create() method creates the underlying window control for controls not loaded from a resource (i.e., designed with the Window Editor) but created at runtime. Normally, it is not necessary to call Create() directly—CA-X# will create the object internally as soon as a window handle is needed.

    <remarks>
      The HTTPFilterContext class provides low-level access to the HTTP communication stream. This class can be used, for example, to filter the data sent by a Web server to a client and exchange certain parts of that data in order to implement a page counter.

      An HTTPFilterContext object can only be created within the entry point function, HttpFilterProc(), of an ISAPI extension DLL. The Init() method requires a valid <paramref name="pFilterContext" /> pointer, because the HTTPFilterContext class is a layer for ISAPI Filter Callback functions contained in the _WINHTTP_FILTER_CONTEXT structure.

    <remarks>
      The intention of this class is that the text would appear as a HyperLink to a www address or as an @ email address and therefore the cursor will appear as the normal hand.
      When the control is clicked on, it will attempt to "open" the text of the control using the OpenLink callback method. If the text is a www address it will open the default browser and attempt to navigate to the address. If the text contains an @ it will be taken as an email address and open the default email client.
      <note type="tip">
        The difference between the HyperLink and the SysLink classes is in the way that the text is used.
        In a HyperLink control, ALL of the text is passed as the hyperlink where as in the SysLink control you can mix display text and hyperlink text.
        Also, in the HyperLink control, ALL of the displayed text is passed through to the ShellExecute method and you must make sure that there is nothing in it which could cause this to fail.

  <Icon>
    <summary>
      Create an icon, which is a small bitmap that the system displays for a window when it is iconized in its owner window.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      X# provides a set of predefined icons, defined in Icon:Init(). Use the AppWindow:Icon property to assign an icon for each application window.
      Visual Object includes an Icon Editor which produces standard system icon files. There is also a large library of system icons. These icon files are compatible with the standard format on the system, so any other icon file or Icon Editor may also be used. To use such an icon file, create an icon resource with the RESOURCE statement and reference it when instantiating an icon. Refer to the IDE User Guide for more information on using and editing the standard icons.
      <note type="tip">An icon's size and color range is system-dependent.</note>
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example demonstrates the use of one of the standard icons:
      <code language="X#">
        CLASS MyWindow INHERIT TopAppWindow
        METHOD Init() CLASS MyWindow
        SUPER:Init()
        SELF:Icon := Icon{ICONASTERISK}
      </code>
      This code fragment emphasizes three things:
      Any Init() method of a class that inherits must call SUPER:Init().
      The pseudo-variable Icon is an access/assign pair in class AppWindow.
      ICONASTERISK identifies one of the standard icons.
      The following example provides an application window with a custom icon:
      <code language="X#">
        CLASS MyTopAppWin INHERIT TopAppWindow
        METHOD Init CLASS MyTopAppWin
        SUPER:Init()
        SELF:Icon := Icon{IDI_APPICON}
        RESOURCE IDI_APPICON ICON app.ico
      </code>

      In Windows, icons are defined in a resource entity using the keyword ICON, referencing the name of the file created by the Icon Editor.
    </example>
  </Icon>
  <Icon.ctor>
    <summary>
      Construct an icon.

    <remarks>
      An image list is an object that is essentially a collection of icons and/or bitmaps of the same size. Image lists provide a way to manage icons and bitmaps in groups rather than as individual objects. They are typically used by tab, list view, and tree view controls, which refer to particular images in the list by their sequential index. Image lists are used by controls for image manipulation; as a result, methods such as BeginDrag(), DragMove(), EndDrag(), and Handle() are used by the system and should generally not be used directly.

    <summary>
      Register an application as a client able to request and receive data from a designated server application.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      In X#, the IPC... classes provides a means of implementing DDE conversations between DDE-compatible applications. DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) is a type of interprocess communication (IPC) that uses shared memory to exchange data between applications. IPC is governed by a DDE management library, an underlying DLL in Windows.
      In such a conversation, there is a client and a server. The client requests data from the server about particular topics and items, and the server supplies the requested data. The applications, after requesting to be a client or server (or both), then exchange updates as soon as new data becomes available. These exchanges are not necessarily initiated by the user.
      Each IPC client must uniquely identify the server with which it wishes to communicate, and then request data updates. After the initial transfer, the client is informed of any changes to the transferred data in the server by means of an IpcDataUpdateEvent.

    </summary>
    <remarks>
      In X#, the IPC... classes provides a means of implementing DDE conversations between DDE-compatible applications. DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) is a type of interprocess communication (IPC) that uses shared memory to exchange data between applications. IPC is governed by a DDE management library, an underlying DLL in Windows.
      In such a conversation, there is a client and a server. The client requests data from the server about particular topics and items, and the server supplies the requested data. The applications, after requesting to be a client or server (or both), then exchange updates as soon as new data becomes available. These exchanges are not necessarily initiated by the user.
      Each IPC client must uniquely identify the server with which it wishes to communicate, and then request data updates. After the initial transfer, the client is informed of any changes to the transferred data in the server by means of an IpcDataUpdateEvent object.

    <remarks>
      The IRequest class retrieves the values that the client browser passed to the server during an HTTP request. The variables are internally stored by collections in the following order:
      1.	QueryString
      2.	Form
      3.	Cookies
      4.	ClientCertificate
      5.	ServerVariables
      The IRequest class provides the following kinds of methods:
      Methods to retrieve these collections as arrays containing value {name, value} pairs for each collection (e.g., GetForms()).
      Methods to retrieve a certain value of one of these collections (e.g., GetForm("firstname")).
      Methods to retrieve the value without the knowledge about to what collection it belongs (e.g., GetItem("firstname")).

    <remarks>
      The GetClientCertificate() method retrieves a certification field (specified in the X.509 standard) from the request issued by the Web browser. If a Web browser uses the SSL3.0/PCT1 protocol (i.e., URL starts with "https://" instead of "http://") to connect to a server and the server requests certification, the browser sends the certification field. If no certificate is sent, the collection array is empty and the return value is NULL_STRING.

    <param name="oIServer">An IServer object instance.</param>
    <remarks>
      An IWriteCookie object instance can be created by the IResponse:GetCookies() method because it is directly associated with an HTTP request. Therefore, you do not have to create this object yourself. Rather, use it for an ASP Component application via the IScriptingContext:Response:GetCookies() method.
    </remarks>

  <LineObject>
    <summary>
      Create a LineObject object; this type of entity is part of the DrawObject hierarchy, which provides a means of displaying and manipulating various objects.
    </summary>
    <example>
      To draw a LineObject object, call Window:Draw() with the LineObject object as its argument. The window does the drawing by asking each object to draw itself—for example:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD Expose(oEvent) CLASS MyWindow
        LOCAL oLine AS OBJECT
        oLine := LineObject{Point{10,10},Point{20,20}}

      A pen associated with this LineObject object.
      The most common reason to change the pen is to redraw an existing line temporarily in a different color to highlight the fact that the user has selected that line.
      In Windows, the pen specified by <paramref name="oPen" /> should not be deleted while it is selected.

  </LineObject.Size>
  <ListBox>
    <summary>
      Create a list box.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      List boxes and combo boxes display a list of items or choices to the user. The list box methods will allow you to add, arrange, remove, and interrogate the list of items. When one of the items is selected, ListBox:CurrentItem, ListBox:CurrentItemNo, ListBox:TextValue, and ListBox:Value are updated. Either a one-dimensional or two-dimensional array is specified in the FillUsing() method, with a row for each of the items available for selection. With a two-dimensional array, the first element is called the display value, and the second element is called the return value. When an item is selected, ListBox:TextValue contains the first element (the display value), and ListBox:Value contains the second element (the return value). If no item is selected, ListBox:TextValue is NULL_STRING and ListBox:Value is NIL.
      A list box may be bound to a field (character, date, logical, numeric, or memo) in a server. The field's data value is stored in ListBox:Value. The list box compares the data value to the second element values specified in the FillUsing() array, and if a match is found, the first element (the display value) is stored in ListBox:TextValue. In a "no-match" situation, the list box shows no item selected, ListBox:CurrentItem is NULL_STRING, ListBox:CurrentItemNo is set to 0, and ListBox:TextValue and ListBox:Value reflect the field contents. If an item is selected, ListBox:CurrentItemNo is set to a number between 1 and ListBox:ItemCount, and the corresponding second element is stored as ListBox:Value and as the field's data value.
      <note type="tip">All array index references start at 1.</note>
      You can also create a multiple selection list box, which allows you to manage multiple items within a list box. Any number of items in a list box can be selected together (referred to as multiple selection). Each item is toggled on/off each time the user clicks on it.
      A multiple selection list box is created by selecting the LBOXMULTIPLESEL style when creating a ListBox object. Certain properties and methods of this class apply specifically to multiple selection list boxes, including SelectedCount access, ChangeSelected(), ClearSelection(), DeselectItem(), FirstSelected(), NextSelected(), and SelectItem().
    </remarks>
    <example>
      This example creates and fills a list box with a list of animals:
      <code language="X#">
        CLASS MyWindow INHERIT TopAppWindow
        HIDDEN oLB AS OBJECT
        METHOD Init() CLASS MyWindow
        SUPER:Init()
        oLB := ListBox{SELF,42,Point{10,10},;
        Dimension{100,40}}
        oLB:AddItem("Pig")
        oLB:AddItem("Cow")
        oLB:AddItem("Horse")
        oLB:Show()
      </code>

      A X# list box is equivalent to a Windows list box with the LBS_NOTIFY and LBS_SORT styles.
      List boxes are normally specified in the resource entity like this:
      <code language="X#">
        RESOURCE IDD_ABOUT DIALOG 20, 20, 160, 80
        STYLE WS_POPUP | WS_DLGFRAME

  <ListBox.FillUsing>
    <summary>
      Specify the set of values to be displayed in the list box, using an array or a data server. These values act as a constraint on the values that may be entered in the list box, and optionally as a translation between program values and display values.
    </summary>
    <param name="oList">Sorted List of String/Usual pairs </param>
    <param name="aContents">
      An array containing the values to be placed in the list box. A two-dimensional array may be used to define the values to be returned to the program when a list item is selected, separately from the text strings shown in the list; this 'other' value is what is returned in the ListBox:Value property, and what is stored in the database if the control is associated with a database field.
      Thus, the array may be specified in one of two formats:
      <list type="table">
        <item>
          <term>1.</term>
          <description>One-dimensional array containing the list of values.</description>
        </item>
        <item>
          <term>2.</term>
          <description>
            Array of two-element arrays, each containing the string to display in the list and the corresponding value returned to the program.
            Note that the two dimensional array has the same structure as that returned by DBServer:GetLookupTable(), and the
            one-dimensional array matches that returned by DBServer:GetArray(). or The data server that is to be used to provide the set of values.
          </description>
        </item>
      </list>
    </param>
    <param name="symField1">The symbolic name of the field that is to be used for the display values. If not specified, the values of the first field are used.</param>
    <param name="symField2">The symbolic name of the field that is to be used for the values that are returned to the program. If not specified, the values of the first field are used.</param>
    <remarks>
      A list box shows the set of valid values for a field. Depending on what type of list box is used, the set of values may act as a constraint on the values that may be retrieved or only as a suggestion. Two sets of values may be specified, allowing for translation of values between the displayed, "human-readable" representation and the internal, programmatic value.
      The FillUsing() method provides a way of specifying the values to be included in the list all at once, instead of constructing the list item by item with the AddItem() method.
      <note type="tip">The list box control may be associated with a database field, just like any other control. Do not confuse this primary field linkage with the possibility of linking the list box to a secondary server used for populating the list.</note>
    </remarks>
    <example>
      Create a list box with different currencies, showing an explicit representation to the user but using a different representation internally:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD Init(...) CLASS OrderWindow
        ...
        oLBCurrency := ListBox{SELF,LBCURRENCY_ID}
        oLBCurrency:FillUsing({;
        {"U.S. Dollars","USD"},;
        {"Can. Dollars","CDN"},;
        {"Mexican Pesos","MEX"},;
        {"Yen","YEN"},;
        {"British Pounds","UK"},;
        {"German Marks","DM"};
        })
        oLBCurrency:Show()
      </code>
      Create a list box that shows the products available in the product table:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD Init(...) CLASS OrderWindow
        ...
        oLBProducts := ListBox{SELF,LBPRODUCTS_ID}
        oLBProducts:FillUsing(oDBProducts,#ProdName,#ProdNo)

    <value>A string representing the display value (first array's element) for the currently selected item.</value>
    <remarks>
      A string representing the display value (first array's element) for the currently selected item, formatted according to the picture clause of the field specification attached to the list box (or combo box). For example the ListBox:TextValue can be "Jones", "01/15/95", or "8". The ListBox:TextValue assign also changes ListBox:CurrentItem, ListBox:CurrentItemNo, ListBox:Modified, ListBox:Value, and ListBox:ValueChanged.
      If the assign does not match one of the display items, then ListBox:TextValue and ListBox:Value are set to the text that could not be matched, and ListBox:CurrentItemNo is set to 0. If the control is bound to a field in a server and the field data value does not match one of the array's second elements, ListBox:TextValue and ListBox:Value contain the field's data value.

  <ListBox.Value>
    <summary>
      A value (second element in the FillUsing() array) representing the currently selected item, formatted according to the picture clause of the field specification attached to the list box (or combo box). For example the TextValue can be "Jones", "01/15/95", or "8". If there is no selected item and the list box is not bound to a field in a server, the ListBox:Value is set to NIL. The ListBox:Value assign also changes ListBox:CurrentItem, ListBox:CurrentItemNo, ListBox:TextValue, and ListBox:ValueChanged.
      If the assigned text does not match one of the return value choices, ListBox:CurrentItemNo is set to 0, and ListBox:TextValue and ListBox:Value are set to the assigned text. In a list box, the ListBox:Value is generally one of the return values, unless the control is bound to a field where the actual contents is not one of the allowable choices, and there is a no-match situation; in this case ListBox:TextValue and ListBox:Value contain the field's data value.
      The data type for ListBox:Value is determined by the field specification of the list box; in turn, controls linked to a data server inherit the field specification—and hence data type—from the field of the server. When the control is made data-aware, by setting its name to the name of a field in the server attached to the data window, ListBox:Value is able to automatically read from and write to this field.
      <note type="tip">ListBox:Value may not always be consistent with what the state of the control, as indicated to the end user. For example, if the data value for the field is not one of the allowed choices for a list box return value, the control will be in a "no-match" situation. In this case the list box will revert to its initial unselected state with ListBox:CurrentItemNo set to 0.</note>

  <Menu>
    <summary>
      Create a menu. Menus consist of items which the user selects for execution; a menu item can be a string, a bitmap, or another menu.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Menus provide the highest level of user control within an application. At the most basic level, a menu is series of items that are displayed in the menu bar (for example, the strings "OpenFile", a question mark bitmap to indicate help, and so on.) When selected, these items perform an action—for example, open a file, exit the application, or get help.
      The items in a menu bar might also contain a submenu as another type of item. When creating a submenu, you generally specify a title (this is the text that appears in the menu bar) and the set of items that belong to that submenu (the items are displayed when the title is activated in the menu bar). For example, a submenu might have the title "File" and items named "Open," "Save," and "Exit."
      Like menus, submenus can contain strings, bitmaps, and other menus. Using submenus allows you to have multi-dimensional menus. In addition, just like any menu, they can be created from a resource entity.
      Each item on a menu is identified by a unique ID. You can then use that ID to refer to the item later in your program (for example, to disable or delete an item).
      Menu commands can be selected with the mouse or with an accelerator key, and can be added, deleted, inserted, and appended as required.
      Items on a menu can be dimmed (or grayed) to indicate that they are disabled, and they can be checked to indicate that they are enabled/selected. You can also add separators to a menu. (A separator is a single line inserted between items on a submenu to group similar commands together.)
      A menu is usually associated with an accelerator table that defines shortcuts (like Ctrl+S for File Save) and a toolbar that provides certain buttons issuing commonly used menu commands. The toolbar and accelerators are usually carried by the menu; assigning a menu to a window automatically assigns the toolbar and accelerators as well.

      Menus in X# generate the following events—MenuInitEvent, MenuSelectEvent, and MenuCommandEvent. They are dispatched to the window that owns the menu that generated the event.
      The event handler methods for these events are as follows:
      Window:MenuInit() is called before a menu is displayed.
      Window:MenuSelect() is called when a menu command is highlighted.
      When the user selects a menu command for execution, the window method that matches the menu command's name is called, if any. If there is no matching method, Window:MenuCommand() is called. Menu commands are also propagated up the window ownership hierarchy. For an in depth discussion of how command events are used, refer to the Programmer's Guide.

      In the Windows, menus are normally created in resource entities. (You can also construct menus dynamically using the Append... or Insert... methods of Menu.)
      For example, in Windows, menus can be created in a resource entity as follows:
      <code language="X#">
        RESOURCE IDM_DEMO MENU
        BEGIN
        POPUP "&amp;File"
        BEGIN
        MENUITEM "&amp;New",			IDMI_NEW
        MENUITEM "&amp;Open...",		IDMI_OPEN
        MENUITEM "&amp;Save",			IDMI_SAVE
        MENUITEM "Save &amp;As...",		IDMI_SAVEAS
        MENUITEM SEPARATOR
        MENUITEM "E&amp;xit",			IDMI_EXIT
        MENUITEM "A&amp;bout Demo...",	IDMI_ABOUT
        END
        END
      </code>
      The easiest way to construct a menu is by using the Menu Editor. It generates the resource, as illustrated in the example above, as well as the subclass used to instantiate the menu, the accelerator table, and the toolbar.

  <MenuInitEvent>
    <summary>
      Provide information about a MenuInitEvent, generated when the user first activates a menu for the first time.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The system generates MenuInitEvent objects before displaying a pull-down menu, allowing the application to initialize items before they are displayed. For example, you can want to dim items that the program is not yet in a position to handle, or you may want to check or uncheck certain items. MenuInitEvent events are passed to Window:MenuInit().
      If you change the menu using the Menu access, you do not need to call the window's Menu assign. When the menu is displayed, it is the modified version.
      Accelerator keys generate MenuInitEvent events if the accelerator invokes a submenu.
    </remarks>
  </MenuInitEvent>

  <MenuSelectEvent>
    <summary>
      Provide information about a MenuSelectEvent, generated whenever a menu item is highlighted on a menu (menu items are highlighted as the user moves either the mouse or the highlight bar up or down a menu).
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      MenuSelectEvent events enable the program to anticipate that the user can activate an item or to provide status information.
      <note type="tip">When a menu item is actually selected (and therefore executed), the system generates a MenuCommandEvent.</note>
      When an accelerator key is executed, a MenuSelectEvent, immediately followed by a MenuCommandEvent, is generated to simulate the mouse route—the various selections that you have to pass over to choose the option. (Thus, the accelerator generates the same event as those generated with a mouse.)
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example prints a different help line in the status bar, depending on which command is currently selected:
      <code language="X#">

      In Windows, multiline edit controls are equivalent to an edit control created with the ES_MULTILINE style. These are normally specified in the resource entity like this:
      <code language="X#">
        RESOURCE IDD_ABOUT DIALOG 20, 20, 160, 80
        STYLE WS_POPUP | WS_DLGFRAME
        BEGIN
        EDITTEXT	IDE_TEXT,10,10,90,45, ES_MULTILINE
        DEFPUSHBUTTON "OK"	 IDB_OK,64,60,32,14, WS_GROUP
        END

      MultiMediaContainer:Dispatch() serves as an internal callback method, dispatching events to various event handlers. It should never be necessary to call this method directly. Instead you should write your own Dispatch() method for derived classes, if you want to handle additional events. Usually the derived class Dispatch() method should call SUPER:Dispatch() to support the inherited event handling.

      If the associated file contains video or audio information (for example, an .AVI or .WAV file), the MultiMediaContainer class creates an MCI window. Using the MCISendMessage() method, you can send any of the MCIWNDM_XXX messages documented in the Win32 SDK help to this window. Using these messages, you can programmatically change the look and behavior of the window, play the multimedia data, etc.

  <NamedArg>
    <summary>
      Provide a class to support OLE named arguments.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      OLE supports the concept of named arguments. On method invocation, an argument name that is defined by the OLE automation server can be attached to the actual parameter value. This allows you to pass parameters in any order and to omit parameters because the server can uniquely identify the parameters using their names. The NamedArg class is used to model this way of parameter passing.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example shows how Named Arguments are used to simplify calling the PrintOut method of the Word.Application class that has lots of arguments.

  <OLEAutoObject>
    <summary>
      Provide a class to define an OLE automation server.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      An OLE automation server is represented through an instance of this class in a X# application. An OLE automation server can be created at runtime using this class without having any information available about the particular server at compile time. All methods, properties, and variables of the automation server are available through the OLEAutoObject object. OLE automation server methods map to X# methods, get properties and variables with read access to Access methods, and set properties and variables with write access to Assign methods.
      While it is often very convenient to create automation servers at runtime on the fly, you might also want to consider generating base classes for specific automation servers using the Automation Server generator in the IDE. Generated OLE automation server base classes inherit from OLEAutoObject and provide compile-time information about the particular server, thereby introducing compile-time checking and speeding up method invocations at runtime.
      Internally this class uses an array of method description objects (type cOleMethod) to store the descriptions of the properties and methods that an OleAutomation server supports.
    </remarks>
  </OLEAutoObject>
  <OLEAutoObject.ctor>
    <summary>
      Construct an OLE automation server.
    </summary>
    <param name="ObjId">A string, IDispatch object, Interface Pointer or OleAutoObject specifying the automation server.</param>
    <param name="nLangID">The language ID for automation servers that support multiple language. The default value is zero.</param>
    <param name="lNoFuncArray">Reserved. The default value is FALSE.</param>
    <param name="fROTCheck">Should X# return a reference to an already running server (TRUE) or create a new instance of the server (FALSE). The default value is FALSE.</param>
    <remarks>
      Init() initializes an OLEAutoObject and tries to link it to the specified automation server.
      Usually, you will specify the automation server (OLE defined PROGID) using its name as a string (i.e., &lt;cServer&gt;). You can, however, specify it as an object of the IDispatch class (i.e., &lt;oIDispatch&gt;). This is required to handle interface hierarchies in OLE automation. A method, property, or variable might return an OLE interface, that in turn represents an automation object with its own methods, properties, and variables. The invoke logic of the automation class will automatically turn a returned OLE automation interface in a new OLEAutoObject object, by first creating an IDispatch object, then creating a new OLEAutoObject object and passing the IDispatch object to its Init() method.
      Alternate parameters are an IDispatch pointer or an OleAutoObject. IDispatch Pointers are handled just like IDispatch objects. When you pass in an OleAutoObject X# will create a second OleAutoObject that points to the same COM Interface. X# will make sure that the reference counting is adjusted to reflect the fact that TWO VO Objects are passing to the same OLE Object.
      The invoke logic in generated subclasses of OLEAutoObject handles return OLE automation interfaces in this manner, so that normally there is no need for the user to pass IDispatch objects to OLEAutoObject:Init().
      OLE automation servers might support different languages for the names of methods, properties, and variables. The desired language is specified through the <paramref name="nLangID" /> argument. The value zero tells the server to use its default language. For details about the supported languages, their identifiers, and the default language, refer to the documentation for your specific automation server.
      The &lt;lNoFuncArray&gt; parameter has to be considered reserved. It is only used by generated subclasses of OLEAutoObject to prevent the Init() method from creating OLEAutoObject:aFuncDesc (an array containing descriptions for all methods, properties, and variables of the automation server). Because this array is not needed by generated subclasses of OLEAutoObject, they call the Init() method using a value of TRUE for this argument. The default value, and the value that is normally used, is FALSE.
      The <paramref name="fROTCheck" /> parameter determines if X# will create a new instance of the server or if it will try to see if the server is already running. The default behavior is to create a new server (fROTCheck = FALSE). When you specify a TRUE for this parameter, X#will inspect the OLE Running Objects Table and try to attach to an already running server by calling the GetActiveObject() API function. When that fails, X# will create a new server
    </remarks>
    <example>
      This example creates a Word Application automation server:
      <code language="X#">
        FUNCTION Start()

      An array containing descriptions of the methods, properties, and variables of the OLE automation server represented by the OLEAutoObject. This array is only intended for use by the OLEAutoObject class—the user must not manipulate it.
      This array exists only for instances of the OLEAutoObject class. Generated automation server classes that inherit from OLEAutoObject do not need this array since the method information is generated and expanded into code.
      The array is used as a kind of Hash table. The position in the array is calculated from the name of the methods or properties. The elements in the array are objects of the class cOleMethod. This class is used to describe the methods from a OleAutoObject.

      When an OLE date field is returned it is an instance of the OleDateTime class and the values can be extracted from this.
      However, by setting the DateTimeAsDate to TRUE, all OLE dates will be returned as VO dates in the standard format.

  <OLEAutoObject.fInit>
    <summary>
      The instantiation of an OLEAutoObject object does not mean that the OLE automation has been successfully started. For example, moving an automation application from one PC to another will cause the application to malfunction if the OLE automation server is not installed on the new PC. In this case trying to use the OLEAutoObject after instantiation would cause runtime error.
      After creating the object, OLEAutoObject:fInit lets you check to see if the OLE automation server has been successfully initialized. It returns TRUE if the OLE automation server has been initialized properly; otherwise, it returns FALSE.

    <remarks>
      <br />Important! In order for this class to work the automation server must implement the IPersistFile interface—most automation servers do not.
      The OLEAutoObjectFromFile class lets you create an automation server object from a file. OLE will determine which automation server a particular file belongs to and automatically start the server and open the file inside it.
    </remarks>

    <param name="cFName">The name of file from which to create the OLE automation server.</param>
    <param name="nLangID">The language ID for automation servers that support multiple language. The default value is zero.</param>
    <remarks>
      Init() initializes an OLEAutoObjectFromFile and tries to link it to the automation server that is registered for the file <paramref name="cFName" />.
      OLE automation servers might support different languages for the names of methods, properties, and variables. The desired language is specified through the <paramref name="nLangID" /> argument. The value zero tells the server to use its default language. For details about the supported languages, their identifiers, and the default language, refer to the documentation for your specific automation server.

    <remarks>
      OLEAutoObjectFromFile:Destroy() shuts down an OLE automation session and releases all the data associated with it. This method is called automatically by OLEAutoObject:Axit(), which is triggered by the garbage collector, but you can also call OLEAutoObjectFromFile:Destroy() directly.

  </OLEAutoObjectFromFile.Destroy>
  <OleBinary>
    <summary>
      Provide a class to support passing Binary Information to Ole Server
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      This class is used to pass binary information to an OleServer, such as the contents of a file. In most cases the Ole Server will expect an array of butes. VO will generate an array of bytes for each OleBinary Argument.
      <note type="tip">
        VO 2.8 SP2 introduces this class. However: this patch does not come with a new repository, so you cannot directly reference the class but must use the CreateInstance() syntax in stead.
      </note>

  <OLEControl>
    <summary>
      Provide a container and wrapper for an OLE control (OCX).
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The OLEControl class implements a wrapper and container for an OLE control (OCX, ActiveX). An OLE control is basically an OLE object with an added automation interface, by which you can program the OCX and set up event handlers to handle events instantiated by the OLE control. To cover the first requirement, OLEControl is derived from OLEObject and, therefore, inherits all of the OLEObject's functionality. The automation interface is provided by an OLEAutoObject, which is a protected member variable of OLEControl initialized using OLEControl:InitAutoObject().
    </remarks>
  </OLEControl>
  <OLEControl.CreateEmbedding>
    <summary>
      Create an OLE control from a program ID.

    <param name="cProgID">The OLE control's program ID.</param>
    <param name="cLicKey">The license key for the OLE control's program.</param>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      Each object provided by an OLE server is uniquely identified by its program ID. These program IDs are stored in the system Registry as described in the OLE server's documentation. OLEControl:CreateEmbedding() creates an embedded OLE control from its program ID and loads it into an OLEControl container.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code responds to a button click by creating an object with the program ID Word.Document.6 within an already existing OLEControl container sitting on a data window:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD PushButton1() CLASS dw
        oDCOLEControl1:CreateEmbedding("Word.Document.6")
      </code>
    </example>
  </OLEControl.CreateEmbedding>
  <OLEControl.CreateFromAppDocStorage>

    </summary>
    <param name="oOLEAppDocStorage">The OLEAppDocStorage object containing the object.</param>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      All OLE controls inserted into a form inside the Window Editor are saved inside a special file called the Application Doc File. When the OLE control is recreated at runtime, the persistent information, including the OLEAutoObject, is loaded from the Application Doc File using OLEControl:CreateFromAppDocStorage().
    </remarks>
  </OLEControl.CreateFromAppDocStorage>
  <OLEControl.Destroy>
    <summary>
      Provide a method to de-instantiate an OLEControl object.
    </summary>
    <param name="oEvent">The event to be handled.</param>
    <seealso cref="T:VO.Event" />
    <remarks>
      This method can be used when an OLEControl object is no longer needed. OLEControl:Destroy() de-instantiates the OLEControl object and allows you to close and free any resources that were opened or created by the object, without waiting for the garbage collector. The associated OLE control is automatically closed and the OLE control's server is shut down, unless it is serving other clients.
    </remarks>
  </OLEControl.Destroy>
  <OLEControl.Dispatch>
    <summary>
      Provide the prototype dispatcher for events within the system when the control has focus; routing various events to their appropriate event handlers.
    </summary>
    <param name="oEvent">The event to be handled.</param>
    <seealso cref="T:VO.Event" />
    <returns>
      TRUE if the event was handled; otherwise, FALSE.
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      OLEControl:Dispatch() serves as an internal callback, dispatching events to various event handlers. It should never be necessary to call this method directly. Instead, you can write your own Dispatch() method for derived classes if you want to handle additional events. Usually the derived class Dispatch() should call SUPER:Dispatch() to support the inherited event handling.
    </remarks>
  </OLEControl.Dispatch>
  <OLEControl.InitAutoObject>

    <returns>
      SELF
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      The OLEAutoObject must be initialized after the OLE control is created. OLEControl:CreateFromAppDocStorage() does this automatically. If you use one of the other Create methods, however, make sure to initialize the OLEAutoObject properly using OLEControl:InitAutoObject().
    </remarks>

    </param>
    <param name="oSource">
      The ID of the resource that defines the layout of the OLE data window. or the resource ID that specifies the location and size of the sub-data window.
      Specifying this argument creates the new OLE data window as a sub-data window on its owner data window (only data window owners can have sub-data windows).
      It should refer to a control defined in the resource entity of the owner data window.
      If <paramref name="oSource" /> is omitted or if <paramref name="oOwner" /> is not a data window, the data window is created as a modal DialogWindow.

  <OLEDataWindow.DeActivate>
    <summary>
      Note 	The functionality in this method has now been incorporated into the Window Class.

      Provide a method that is invoked when the OLE data window is deactivated.
      <br />Important! Deactivate() is a callback method used by X#. Normally, it should not be called in your application code.
    </summary>
    <param name="oEvent">An empty event required to maintain the protocol that all event handlers have exactly one event as their argument.</param>
    <seealso cref="T:VO.Event" />
    <remarks>
      This event handler is normally invoked when another application or window becomes activated. By default, all OLE objects on the OLEDataWindow will be deactivated. If Window:MouseTrapOn() is left on, MouseEvent events cannot be directed to other applications or windows.
    </remarks>

  </OLEDataWindow.MouseButtonDown>
  <OLEDataWindow.Notify>
    <summary>
      Note 	The functionality in this method has now been incorporated into the DataWindow Class.

      Provide an event handler that reflects events that have occurred in the server connected to an OLE data window.
      <br />Important! Notify() is automatically called by the server, and should normally not be called by application code.
    </summary>
    <returns>
      SELF, except if NOTIFYINTENTTOMOVE is specified for <paramref name="kNotifyName" />. In this case, the return value is TRUE if successful; otherwise, FALSE.

      Note 	The functionality in this method has now been incorporated into the DataWindow Class.

      Update the toolbars of any in-place active OLE objects.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      OLEDataWindow:UpdateActiveObject() calls the UpdateTools() method of any currently activated OLE object that the OLE data window contains. It first determines which OLE object control is in-place active, and then replaces the X# container application's toolbars with the OLE server's toolbars. In response to a resizing of the container application, this method causes the OLE object server to rearrange its toolbars.
    </remarks>
  </OLEDataWindow.UpdateActiveObject>
  <OLEDataWindow.ViewAs>
    <summary>
      Note 	The functionality in this method has now been incorporated into the DataWindow Class.

      Specify the view mode of the OLE data window as either browse view or form view.
    </summary>
    <param name="symViewMode">
      Specifies which view mode is to be used. Use one of these symbols:
      Symbol	Description
      #BrowseView	Several records are displayed at the same time, as rows in a spreadsheet-like table with each field corresponding to a column.
      #FormView	A single record is viewed at a time, with its fields displayed in individual controls.
    </param>
    <remarks>
      When a window is switched to a new view mode, a layout is automatically generated if one had not been defined previously.
      Because it takes an argument, OLEDataWindow:ViewAs() is rarely connected directly with a push button or menu command; instead, the OLEDataWindow:ViewForm() and OLEDataWindow:ViewTable() methods (inherited from DataWindow) are used.
      In addition to the functionality provided by the DataWindow base class, the implementation for the OLEDataWindow class also deactivates any activated OLE objects before changing the view.

    <summary>
      Provide the base class for the internal implementation of OLE automation.

    <remarks>
      <br />Important! This class is used for internal implementation only and is not intended to be used directly.

  <OLEObject>
    <summary>
      Provide a container and wrapper for an OLE object.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The OLEObject class serves as the container and wrapper for an OLE object, provided and managed by an OLE server. The OLEObject alone is simply a windowed control that can take exactly one OLE object. The OLE object is created via one of the Create methods, such as OLEObject:CreateFromPasteDialog() or OLEObject:CreateFromAppDocStorage(). Several properties, such as OLEObject:AllowInPlace, control the basic behavior of the OLEObject.
      Note the distinction between OLEObject, which is a class provided by X#, and an OLE object, which is provided by its server and "lives" inside the OLEObject container. Using OLEObject:DetachFromServer(), the current OLE object can be destroyed, but the same OLEObject container can be reused by calling one of the Create methods again.
    </remarks>
  </OLEObject>
  <OLEObject.ctor>
    <summary>
      Construct an OLEObject.
    </summary>
    <param name="oOwner">The window that owns the OLEObject.</param>
    <param name="nID">The unique ID between 1 and 8000 of the OLEObject.</param>
    <param name="nResourceID">The resource ID of OLEObject.</param>
    <param name="oPoint">The origin of the OLEObject in canvas coordinates.</param>
    <param name="oDimension">The dimension of the OLEObject in canvas coordinates.</param>
    <param name="lDataAware">A logical value that is TRUE if the OLEObject is data-aware and otherwise FALSE.</param>
    <example>
      The following code is generated by the Window Editor. It first creates an OLEObject container from a resource, then a HyperLabel is assigned, and finally the OLE object is loaded from the Application Doc File:
      <code language="X#">
        oDCOLEObject1 := OLEObject{SELF, ;
        ResourceID{DW_OLEOBJECT1, _GetInst()}}
        oDCOLEObject1:HyperLabel := HyperLabel{#OLEObject1, ;
        NULL_STRING, NULL_STRING, NULL_STRING}
        oDCOLEObject1:CreateFromAppDocStorage(OLEAppDocStorage{ ;
        "C:\CAVO2x\DATA\Application 5.MDF", "dw", "OLEObject1"})
      </code>
    </example>
  </OLEObject.ctor>
  <OLEObject.Activate>
    <summary>
      Activate the OLE object.
    </summary>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      The method puts the associated OLE object into the active state, which usually allows the user to edit the object.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code shows a push button's click event handler, which activates an OLEObject located on the same data window:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD PushButton1() CLASS dw
        oDCOLEObject1:Activate("Word.Document.6")
      </code>
    </example>
  </OLEObject.Activate>
  <OLEObject.ActivateOnDblClk>
    <summary>
      A logical value that is TRUE if the OLE object is activated by double-clicking on it and FALSE otherwise. The default value for this property is TRUE.
    </summary>
    <value>A logical value that is TRUE if the OLE object is activated by double-clicking on it and FALSE otherwise. The default value for this property is TRUE.</value>

  <OLEObject.AddVerbMenu>
    <summary>
      Insert the OLE object's verb menu into an existing menu.
    </summary>
    <param name="hMenu">The handle of the existing menu.</param>
    <param name="iPos">The position at which the menu should be inserted.</param>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      A OLE object usually supports several actions (called verbs) which a user can perform on the object. An AVI object, for example, can support a Play and an Edit verb. The object's verbs can be invoked via its verb menu, which is added using OLEObject:AddVerbMenu() into an existing menu and is fully managed by the object.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code inserts the verb menu at position two of the pop-up menu with ID one of the container application. Note that the system menu of an MDI child window counts as separate pop-up menu, in case the MDI child window is maximized:
      <code language="X#">
        LOCAL hObjMenu AS PTR
        IF oParent:IsZoomed()
        hObjMenu := oParent:Menu:GetSubMenu(2)
        ELSE
        hObjMenu := oParent:Menu:GetSubMenu(1)
        ENDIF
        SELF:AddVerbMenu(hObjMenu, 2)
      </code>
    </example>
  </OLEObject.AddVerbMenu>
  <OLEObject.AllowInPlace>
    <summary>
      If an OLE object is activated—either by calling OLEObject:Activate() or by double-clicking on the object—the server usually puts the object into edit mode. This editing can happen either inside the X# container application (in-place activation) or in a separate window managed by the server (out-of-place activation). During in-place activation, the server's and the container's menus and toolbars are merged, and the object can be edited inside the container's user interface context.
      OLEObject:AllowInPlace is a logical value that is TRUE if the object is allowed to be activated in-place and FALSE otherwise. The default value for this property is FALSE.
      <note type="tip">The server can deny in-place activation even if OLEObject:AllowInPlace is TRUE.</note>

    <summary>
      Create an OLE object from a program ID.
    </summary>
    <param name="cProgID">The OLE object's program ID.</param>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      Each object provided by an OLE server is uniquely identified by its program ID. These program IDs are stored in the system Registry as described in the OLE server's documentation. OLEObject:CreateEmbedding() creates an embedded OLE object from its program ID and loads it into an OLEObject container.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code responds to a button click by creating an object with the program ID Word.Document.6 within an already existing OLEObject container sitting on a data window:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD PushButton1() CLASS dw
        oDCOLEObject1:CreateEmbedding("Word.Document.6")
      </code>
    </example>
  </OLEObject.CreateEmbedding>
  <OLEObject.CreateEmbeddingFromFile>
    <summary>
      Create an OLE object from a file.
    </summary>
    <param name="cFileName">The file containing the object.</param>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      If an OLE object is given as a file (such as a saved document). you use OLEObject:CreateEmbeddingFromFile() to create an embedded OLE object and load it into its OLEObject container.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code responds to a button click by creating an object from the file \WINWORD\SAMPLE.DOC:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD PushButton1() CLASS dw
        oDCOLEObject1:CreateEmbeddingFromFile("\WINWORD\SAMPLE.DOC")
      </code>
    </example>
  </OLEObject.CreateEmbeddingFromFile>
  <OLEObject.CreateFromAppDocStorage>

      Create an OLE object from an Application Doc File storage.
    </summary>
    <param name="oOLEAppDocStorage">The OLEAppDocStorage object containing the object.</param>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      All OLE objects inserted into a form inside the Window Editor are saved inside a special file called the Application Doc File. When the OLE object is recreated at runtime, the persistent information is loaded from the Application Doc File using OLEObject:CreateFromAppDocStorage().
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code is generated by the Window Editor to load the OLE object from the associated Application Doc File.
      <code language="X#">
        oDCOLEObject1:CreateFromAppDocStorage(OLEAppDocStorage{ ;
        "C:\CAVO25\DATA\Application 5.MDF", "dw", "OLEObject1"}
      </code>
    </example>
  </OLEObject.CreateFromAppDocStorage>
  <OLEObject.CreateFromDBStorage>
    <summary>
      Create an OLE object from a database storage.
    </summary>
    <param name="oOLEDBStorage">The OLEDBStorage object describing the database storage.</param>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      X# supports the ability to store an OLE object in a DBF database. To assign a new value to the OLEObject container, you pass an OLEDBStorage object to OLEObject:CreateFromDBStorage(). To save the persistent information of an OLE object in the database, you pass an OLEDBStorage object to OLEObject:SaveToDBStorage(). You usually get the OLEDBStorage object as a result of a FieldGet() call.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code shows how an OLEDBStorage object received from the FieldGet() call is used to create an OLE object and insert it into the OLEObject container:
      <code language="X#">
        LOCAL oDBStg AS OLEDBStorage
        oDBStg := FieldGet(FieldPos(#PaintObject))
        oOLEContainer:CreateFromDBStorage(oDBStg)

    <summary>
      Create an OLE object from the standard Insert Object dialog.
    </summary>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      OLEObject:CreateFromInsertDialog() brings up the standard Insert Object dialog, allowing the user to select an object type which is then used to create a new OLE object for this OLEObject container.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code first instantiates a new OLEObject container then uses OLEObject:CreateFromInsertDialog() to create an OLE object for the container. The OLEObject container is destroyed in case the OLE object creation failed—for example, because the user clicked on the dialog's Cancel button:
      <code language="X#">
        LOCAL oOLE AL OLEObject
        oOLE := DraggableOLEObject{SELF}
        oOLE:AllowInPlace := TRUE

  <OLEObject.CreateFromOLEDragEvent>
    <summary>
      Create an OLE object from an OLEDragEvent.
    </summary>
    <param name="oOLEDragEvent">The OLEDragEvent object.</param>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      A window that is registered as an OLE drop target using ChileAppWindow:EnableOLEDropTarget() can handle OLE drag and drop events and create new OLE objects in response to such events. In the associated handlers, an OLEDragEvent object is passed as a parameter that can be used to create a new OLE object by calling OLEObject:CreateFromOLEDragEvent().
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code enables a data window as a drop target and creates a new OLE object inside its OLEDrop handler. It also checks the name of the OLE object to allow only WordPad documents:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD EnableOLEDropTarget CLASS DropTargetDataWindow
        SELF:EnableOLEDropTarget(TRUE)
        METHOD OLEDrop(oOLEDragEvent) CLASS MyChild
        LOCAL oOLE AS OLEObject
        LOCAL lRet AS LOGIC
        IF oOLEDragEvent:ObjectName == "WordPad Document"
        oOLE := OLEObject{SELF}
        oOLE:AllowInPlace := TRUE
        oOLE:AllowResize := TRUE
        IF oOLE:CreateFromOLEDragEvent(oOLEDragEvent)

    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      OLEObject:CreateFromPasteDialog() brings up the standard Paste Special dialog, allowing the user to select an object from the Clipboard which is then used to create a new OLE object for this OLEObject container.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code first instantiates a new OLEObject container then uses OLEObject:CreateFromPasteDialog() to create an OLE object for the container. The OLEObject container is destroyed in case the OLE object creation failed—for example, because the user clicked on the dialog's Cancel button:

    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      A linked OLE object is stored outside the container's storage. This allows other applications to use and change the OLE object as well. OLEObject:CreateLink() creates a new linked OLE object and loads it into the OLEObject container.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code creates a linked OLE object from a text document into an OLEObject:
      <code language="X#">oMyTextObject:CreateLink("\WINWORD\SAMPLE.DOC")</code>
    </example>
  </OLEObject.CreateLink>

    <summary>
      Provide a method to de-instantiate an OLEObject.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      This method can be used when an OLEObject object is no longer needed. OLEObject:Destroy() de-instantiates the OLEObject object and allows you to close and free any resources that were opened or created by the object, without waiting for the garbage collector. The associated OLE object is automatically closed and the OLE object's server is shut down, unless it is serving other clients.
    </remarks>
  </OLEObject.Destroy>

    <summary>
      Remove a contained OLE object and cut the link to its server.
    </summary>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      Since OLEObject serves as a container for any OLE object, it is possible to remove the current object, cut the link to its server, and load a new OLE object into the container by using one of the Create methods. In the process, OLEObject:DetachFromServer() removes the current OLE object and cuts the link to the object's server.
    </remarks>

    <returns>
      TRUE if the event was handled; otherwise, FALSE.
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      OLEObject:Dispatch() serves as an internal callback, dispatching events to various event handlers. It should never be necessary to call this method directly. Instead, you can write your own Dispatch() method for derived classes if you want to handle additional events. Usually the derived class Dispatch() should call SUPER:Dispatch() to support the inherited event handling.

      X# supports the ability to store an OLE object in a DBF database. To assign a new value to the OLEObject container, you pass an OLEDBStorage object to OLEObject:CreateFromDBStorage(). To save the persistent information of an OLE object in the database, you pass an OLEDBStorage object to OLEObject:SaveToDBStorage(). You usually get the OLEDBStorage object as a result of a FieldGet() call.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code shows how to load an OLE object form a database and save it back again:
      <code language="X#">
        LOCAL oDBStg AS OLEDBStorage
        oDBStg := FieldGet(FieldPos(#PaintObject))
        oOLEContainer:CreateFromDBStorage(oDBStg)
        // do some editing with the OLE object
        oOLEContainer:SaveToDBStorage(oDBStg)
      </code>
    </example>
  </OLEObject.SaveToDBStorage>
  <OLEObject.ServerName>
    <summary>
      The container application can ask the OLE object for long and short versions of the object's name, as well as its servers name. OLEObject:ServerName returns the name of the OLE object's server.
    </summary>
    <value>The container application can ask the OLE object for long and short versions of the object's name, as well as its servers name. OLEObject:ServerName returns the name of the OLE object's server.</value>
  </OLEObject.ServerName>
  <OLEObject.SetHostNames>
    <summary>
      Set the name of the container application and the current document.
    </summary>
    <param name="cApp">The name of the container application.</param>
    <param name="cDoc">The name of the current document.</param>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      These names are used during out-of-place editing in the server's window to identify the OLE object container application and the document in which it is located.
    </remarks>
  </OLEObject.SetHostNames>
  <OLEObject.ShortName>
    <summary>
      The container application can ask the OLE object for long and short versions of the object's name, as well as its servers name. OLEObject:ShortName returns the short version of the object's name.
    </summary>
    <value>The container application can ask the OLE object for long and short versions of the object's name, as well as its servers name. OLEObject:ShortName returns the short version of the object's name.</value>
  </OLEObject.ShortName>
  <OLEObject.UpdateTools>
    <summary>
      Update the container's toolbars.
    </summary>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      Whenever an OLE object is in-place active, the server's toolbars can replace the X# container application's toolbars. In response to a resizing of the container application, OLEObject:UpdateToolbars() causes the OLE object server to rearrange its toolbars.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following code shows how a X# container application uses OLEObject:UpdateToolbars() in response to a resize event:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD Resize(oResizeEvent) CLASS MyShell
        LOCAL oOLE AS OBJECT
        LOCAL oChild AS MyChild
        SUPER:Resize(oResizeEvent)
        oChild := SELF:GetActiveMDIChildObject()
        IF oChild != NULL_OBJECT
        oOLE := oChild:GetActiveOLEObject()
        IF oOLE != NULL_OBJECT
        oOLE:UpdateTools()
        ENDIF
        ENDIF
      </code>
    </example>
  </OLEObject.UpdateTools>
  <OLEShellWindow>
    <summary>
      Create a specialized shell window that includes support for in-place active OLE objects.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Note 	The functionality in the methods of this class has now been incorporated into the ShellWindow Class. The class name is retained for backward compatibility only.
    </remarks>
  </OLEShellWindow>
  <OLEShellWindow.ctor>
    <summary>
      Note -

      Construct an OLE shell window.
    </summary>
    <param name="oOwner">The window that owns the OLE shell window.</param>
  </OLEShellWindow.ctor>
  <OLEShellWindow.Dispatch>
    <summary>
      Note -

      Provide the prototype dispatcher for events within the system when the OLE shell window has focus, routing various events to their appropriate event handlers.
    </summary>
    <param name="oEvent">The event to be handled.</param>
    <seealso cref="T:VO.Event" />
    <returns>
      TRUE if the event was handled; otherwise, FALSE.
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/Callback/*" />
      This method serves as an internal callback, dispatching events to various event handlers. It should never be necessary to call this method directly. Instead, you can write your own Dispatch() method for derived classes if you want to handle additional events. Usually the derived class Dispatch() should call SUPER:Dispatch() to support the inherited event handling.
      In addition to the functionality provided by the ShellWindow base class, the implementation for the OLEShellWindow class also includes support for handling in-place active OLE objects. For example, whenever the shell window is resized, it automatically asks the activated OLE objects to update their toolbars.

  <OpenDialog>
    <summary>
      Present the user with a standard "file open" dialog box.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      This type of dialog box presents the user with a list of file names. It allows the user to select a name from the list (or type the name of an existing file), and provides the ability to specify drive and/or directory if necessary.
      If a user enters a file name that does not already exist, Windows displays a modal dialog box indicating that the file name does not exist for the specified drive, directory, and file type.
    </remarks>

    <remarks>
      <note type="tip">
        If the :SetFilter( ) method is going to be used, cFileName must be specified as "" because without this the filter will have no effect and the default of "*.*" will take effect so as to show all files.

    </remarks>
  </OpenDialog.ctor>
  <Pair>
    <summary>
      Provide the base class from which all X# objects containing ordered pairs of values are subclassed.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <br />Important! Pair is an abstract class and should not be used directly—instead, use one of its subclasses, which include Dimension, Point, Range, and Selection.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      In this example, fractions are represented as ordered pairs of integers:
      <code language="X#">

  <PaletteDialog>
    <summary>
      Present the user with a standard color palette dialog box, allowing the user to define custom colors.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      This type of dialog box presents the user with a palette of available colors as a series of "boxes," allowing the user to select a color by clicking a box. It also allows the user to create and select their own custom colors.
    </remarks>

  <Pen>
    <summary>
      Create a pen, which can be used to draw lines in a particular color, style, and width. Pens are used by the Window:LineTo() method and the DrawObject hierarchy.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      X# provides a set of predefined pens, which are specified in the Pen:Init() method (the default color and width is used). In addition, if desired, you can also create a brush by specifying a color, line style, and width.
      Each window has a current pen, which can be set or changed using the Window:Pen property. A window's pen is used in subsequent line and rectangle drawing operations, and should not be deleted while it is the current selection.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example creates a pen and draws a line:
      <code language="X#">
        oMyPen := Pen{Color{COLORRED}, LINESOLID, 1}
        oOldPen := oMyWin:Pen
        oMyWin:Pen := oMyPen

  <Pen.Destroy>
    <summary>
      Provide a method to de-instantiate a Pen object.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      This method can be used when a Pen object is no longer needed. Pen:Destroy() de-instantiates the Pen object and allows you to close and free any resources that were opened or created by the object, without waiting for the garbage collector.

  <PieObject.Draw>
    <summary>
      Draw a PieObject object which represents a pie-shaped portion of an ellipse.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/Callback/*" />
      This method should not be invoked directly in the application code--it is invoked in X# by Window:Draw().
    </remarks>
    <example>
      To draw a PieObject object, call Window:Draw() with the PieObject object as its argument. The window does the drawing by asking each object to draw itself--for example:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD Expose(oEvent) CLASS MyWindow
        LOCAL oPie AS OBJECT
        oPie := PieObject{Point{10,10},;

        Pen{Color{COLORBLACK}},;
        Brush{Color{COLORRED}}, 0, 180}

    </example>
  </PieObject.Draw>
  <Point>
    <summary>
      Create a point, which is used to describe a location on the canvas of a window.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The Point class does not interpret the coordinates—whether they are screen or canvas coordinates is context-dependent.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      For an example using the Point class, refer to the ResourceFile class example.
    </example>
  </Point>
  <Point.ctor>
    <summary>

  <Pointer>
    <summary>
      Create a mouse cursor, which is used to visually represent the mouse in a window.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      X# provides a set of predefined pointers, defined in Pointer:Init(). In addition, if desired, you can also create pointers from resource entities.
      Each window can have its own pointer, and various pointer characteristics can be set, changed, or interrogated. As the pointer moves from the canvas area of one window to another, the GUI changes the pointer representation to that of the new window.
      Tip: In X#, the class Pointer corresponds to a mouse cursor; use class Cursor to create text cursors.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example provides an application window with a custom cursor:
      <code language="X#">
        CLASS MyTopAppWin INHERIT TopAppWindow
        METHOD Init CLASS MyTopAppWin
        SUPER:Init()
        SELF:Pointer := Pointer{IDC_APPCURSOR}
        RESOURCE IDC_APPCURSOR CURSOR app.cur
      </code>

      In Windows, pointers are sometimes called cursors. You can create a pointer in a resource entity.
    </example>
  </Pointer>
  <Pointer.ctor>
    <summary>
      Load a pointer from a resource entity.

  <Printer>
    <summary>
      Create an object that represents a single print job.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      It is essential to check the validity of a Printer object—using Printer:IsValid()—before using it.
      To use a printer, the application should call Printer:Start(), which repeatedly calls Printer:PrinterExpose() for each page printed until the final page, in which it returns FALSE. Printer:Start() returns when the print job is finished.
      You can also:
      Determine the size of the page using Window:CanvasArea and Window:WindowArea to return the size of the printable area and total page size, respectively
      Scale the printout using Window:Size
      Determine the origin using Window:Origin (for example, to create margins)
      X# will only print the correct font if it exists for your printer; otherwise, the font that is most similar is used.
      Printing is done in printer coordinates, which are device dependent. Use the methods described here to scale and size your printout. Also note that for business printing, such as management reports, invoices, and notification letters, it is usually more convenient to design a report with the Report Editor and then run the report using the ReportQueue class. For more information, refer to the Programmer's Guide.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example prints the text "Hello World":
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD PrinterExpose(oPEE) CLASS PrinterClass
        SELF:TextPrint("Hello World",Point{30,30})
        RETURN FALSE			// Nothing more to print

  </Printer.ctor>
  <Printer.Abort>
    <summary>
      Instruct the printer to abort the current print job.

    <remarks>
      Typically, you would create and display a dialog before starting the print job. If the user presses a push button on the dialog window to cancel the job, the Window:ButtonClick() event handler would invoke this method.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      This example displays a dialog and starts a print job. If the Abort push button is pressed, the Window:ButtonClick() event handler aborts the job:

  <PushButton>
    <summary>
      Create a push button, which can be used to initiate an event and associated action when clicked on by the user.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Unlike check boxes and radio buttons, which have an identifiable state, push buttons have no state; they are always ready to be clicked. However, you can specify one of the push buttons on a window to be the default button, in which case it can be activate by pressing the Enter key; the default push button is indicated by its heavy border.

      In Windows, push buttons are the equivalent to a button with the BS_PUSHBUTTON style. The style BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON is also very useful because the button automatically gets focus in a dialog box.
      In Windows, push buttons can be created in a resource entity as follows:
      <code language="X#">
        RESOURCE IDD_ABOUT DIALOG 20, 20, 160, 120

  <RadioButton>
    <summary>
      Create a radio button.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Radio buttons are typically presented in related groups and provide mutually exclusive responses to a condition where only one choice is appropriate. (For example, a group of radio buttons might allow you to choose Inches, Centimeters, or Picas.)
      Only one radio button can be on in each radio button group. When a different button is pressed, the previously selected button is turned off. In the Window Editor, the Group style setting is checked for each radio button group, to designate the first control in each group. If you do not explicitly create two or more groups, then there will be only one group for the entire window and only one radio button may be selected at a time.
      A radio button is said to be "pressed" when it is filled in, and the RadioButton:Pressed access is TRUE. Like check boxes, radio buttons maintain their state between events. When you create a radio button group using the Window Editor, code is generated so that it functions automatically. The caption is used to indicate which button in the group is pressed, and the selected button's group value is stored in the RadioButton:Value.
      Radio buttons may not be bound to a field in a server, like other controls. Instead, a radio button group may be bound to a field.

      In Windows, radio buttons are equivalent to a button with the BS_RADIOBUTTON style. The style BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON is also very useful because the button is automatically turned on and off without any code being written in the system's Window:ButtonClick() event handler.
      In Windows, radio buttons can be created in a resource entity as follows:
      <code language="X#">
        RESOURCE IDD_ABOUT DIALOG 20, 20, 160, 120
        STYLE WS_POPUP | WS_DLGFRAME

  <RadioButtonGroup>
    <summary>
      A group of radio buttons considered as a combination control, presenting a set of options and returning a single value.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Radio buttons are commonly used to allow selection of one among a specific list of options. However, treating several radio buttons as individual controls requires explicit management of the behavior of the buttons: when one is selected, the program must turn off the other buttons in the group. Individual radio buttons are also not suited for linking to a database: databases typically do not have several fields representing linked properties, but rather a single field that can take on different values.
      The radio button group is a higher level control that automatically handles the interlinking of the buttons. It also links to database fields in a more intelligent way than individual radio buttons: the group as a whole is considered as one control that takes one of a number of specific values.
      Since the radio button group is the control that you deal with, and its constituent radio buttons are not directly referenced by the program, properties such as the hyperlabel, field specification, caption, value, and text value are attached to the group. The value is either the number of the radio button which is currently selected in the sequence or one of the values specified for a radio button in a two-dimensional array through FillUsing(). The text value is the same value formatted according to the picture clause of the field specification attached to the group (to get the caption displayed next to the radio buttons, retrieve the selected button and reference its caption property. Note that the data type and picture of the group's field specification are used and the field specs of the individual radio buttons are ignored.
      The radio button group behaves similarly to a list box or combo box and may be used as an alternative to any constrained single-selection list box when the number of options is small and fixed. (Although the radio button group supports variable caption strings for the individual buttons, a list box is usually a better choice for very dynamic data.)
      A radio button group is created empty and radio buttons are associated with it through the FillUsing() method. If you create a radio button using the Window Editor, the FillUsing( ) method in the generated source code defines a two-dimensional array, with one row for each button. The first element contains the caption of the radio button and the second element contains its group value.  When a button is pressed, the radio button group's TextValue contains the first element (the button caption), and Value contains the second element (the group value). If no button is pressed, RadioButtonGroup:TextValue is NULL_STRING and RadioButtonGroup:Value is NIL.
      A radio button group may be bound to a field in a server. The field's data value is stored in RadioButtonGroup:Value. The radio button group compares the field's data value to the second element values specified in the FillUsing() array, and if a match is found, the first element (the button caption) is stored in RadioButtonGroup:TextValue. If there is no match, RadioButtonGroup:TextValue is NULL_STRING. If a button is pressed, the corresponding second element is stored as RadioButtonGroup:Value, and this value is written to the server.

  <RadioButtonGroup.Disable>
    <summary>
      Disable a radio button group (until a subsequent call to RadioButtonGroup:Enable()).
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Disabled radio button groups are not active (that is, radio button cannot be clicked) and, therefore, they do not send events to their owner windows. Note that under Windows, a disabled radio button group is dimmed.
    </remarks>
  </RadioButtonGroup.Disable>
  <RadioButtonGroup.Enable>
    <summary>
      Enable a radio button group that was previously disabled.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Enabling a radio button group allows it to generate events and to send the events to its owner window when the user manipulates the radio button group. The dimming of disabled radio button groups is removed, and it is restored to its normal appearance.
      By default, radio button groups are enabled until disabled, so there is no need to call this Enable() method unless Disable() was previously called.
    </remarks>
  </RadioButtonGroup.Enable>
  <RadioButtonGroup.FillUsing>
    <summary>
      Specify the radio buttons that make up the group and the set of values corresponding to these buttons, using an array.
    </summary>
    <param name="aContents">
      The array containing existing radio buttons or the values that should be used to create radio buttons. A two-dimensional array may be used to define the values to be returned to the program when a radio button is selected; this 'other' value is what is returned in the RadioButtonGroup:Value property, and what is stored in the database if the control is associated with a database field. If a one-dimensional array is specified, the values are returned as 1, 2, 3...
      Thus, the array may be specified in one of two formats:
      1.	One-dimensional array containing radio button objects that are to be linked to the group
      2.	Two-dimensional arrays, each element containing a RadioButton object and the corresponding value returned to the program
      Note: the two dimensional array has the same structure as that returned by DBServer:GetLookupTable().
    </param>
    <remarks>
      For fixed structures, the individual radio buttons may be created as regular controls, either dynamically or through a resource entity, and assigned to the group through the FillUsing() method.
      <note type="tip">The radio button group may be associated with a database field, just like any other control.</note>

      The data type of the control's Value is determined by its field specification; in turn, controls linked to a data server inherit the field specification—and hence data type—from the field of the server. When the control is made data-aware, by setting its name to the name of a field in the server attached to the data window, Value is able to automatically read from and write to this field.

For example, if the data value for the field is not among the group value settings for the radio buttons in a radio button group, the control will be in a "no-match" situation.

  <ReportQueue>
    <summary>
      Manage Report Editor reporting activities, as well as the appearance of the Report Editor window.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The ReportQueue class allows an application to create, edit, print, preview, and save reports using report definition files (*.RET) created and formatted using the Report Editor.
    </remarks>
  </ReportQueue>
  <ReportQueue.ctor>
    <summary>
      Construct a report queue.
    </summary>
    <param name="oOwner">The window that owns the ReportQueue object.</param>
    <param name="cServerName">
      The Report Editor server to be used. If not specified, the default value is 'Report Editor', which is the Report Editor runtime engine.
    </param>
    <remarks>
      <note type="tip">Report Editor is the only server that is supported.</note>
      ReportQueue:Init() creates a ReportQueue object owned by a window. This object can then be used for sequential reporting tasks.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      This example creates a shell window containing a ReportQueue object:
      <code language="X#">
        CLASS MyShellWindow INHERIT ShellWindow
        HIDDEN oRQ AS OBJECT
        METHOD Start() CLASS App
        LOCAL oSW := MyShellWind{}
        oSW:Show()
        SELF:Exec()
        METHOD Init() CLASS MyShellWind
        SUPER:Init()
        // Initializes the server
        oRQ := ReportQueue{SELF,"Report Editor"}
      </code>
    </example>
  </ReportQueue.ctor>
  <ReportQueue.ActiveFile>
    <summary>
      The report definition file the Report Editor server was just using. This information can be used within an AppWindow:ReportNotification() method.
    </summary>
    <value>The report definition file the Report Editor server was just using. This information can be used within an AppWindow:ReportNotification() method.</value>
  </ReportQueue.ActiveFile>
  <ReportQueue.Close>
    <summary>
      Close a report.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      When a program has finished with a report, it should close the report to reduce the Report Editor's memory usage. This does not close the Report Editor; only the open report within it.
      The ReportQueue keeps a stack of the reports it opened by calls to the ReportQueue:Open() method (but it does not have visibility to the extra files the user opens via the Report Editor's menu). Once all reports are closed (via the ReportQueue:Close() method or the Report Editor menu), the ReportQueue knows of no reports that are open and rejects any further calls to print, preview, or export "the current report," until the next ReportQueue:Open() call.
      ReportQueue:Close() displays its status in the owner window's status bar.
      Even if the ReportQueue believes that the Report Editor has no report open, the Close() method still sends the FILE.CLOSE command to the Report Editor. This command is quietly ignored by the Report Editor, so it is always safe to call ReportQueue:Close().
      The ReportQueue:Close() method totally closes a report. The ReportQueue:Close() method closes a preview (if open), and/or closes the report definition, depending on which window type is open.
      The Report Editor advises the ReportQueue whenever a report or view is closed (whether the close was initiated by ReportQueue or the user).
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example closes a report definition:
      <code language="X#">
        LOCAL oReportQueue := ReportQueue{SELF,;
        "Report Editor"}
        oReportQueue:Open("one.ret")
        oReportQueue:Close()
      </code>
    </example>
  </ReportQueue.Close>
  <ReportQueue.CloseAll>
    <summary>
      Close all reports.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      CloseAll() displays its status in the owner window's status bar. It leaves both the Report Editor server and your program running. CloseAll() can be called safely at any time, and is probably useful both in exception handlers and in clean-up routines.
    </remarks>
  </ReportQueue.CloseAll>
  <ReportQueue.ConnectToDB>
    <summary>
      Connect to an ODBC data source.
    </summary>
    <param name="cDataSourceName">The name of the ODBC data source to connect to. If no data source is specified, a dialog box will appear so that one can be selected.</param>
    <param name="cUserName">The ODBC user name for this data source.</param>
    <param name="cPassword">The ODBC password or authorization string for this data source.</param>
    <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/ReturnsLogic/*" />
    <remarks>
      The Report Editor requires an active database connection. Before opening a report, you must create a data source for the report database.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example connects to a "CA Xbase" data source:
      <code language="X#">oRQ:ConnectToDB("CA Xbase")</code>
    </example>
  </ReportQueue.ConnectToDB>
  <ReportQueue.DataUpdate>
    <summary>
      Handle DataUpdateEvent, if one occurs. Provide this event handler in your derived ReportQueue class if you require special handling of events.
      <br />Important! You should neither attempt to call nor provide alternative implementations to this method. Instead, you can provide extra handling of events in your derived version of AppWindow:ReportNotification().
    </summary>
    <param name="oIpcDataUpdateEvent">Stores the topic name, item name, and the changed data as a string.</param>
    <remarks>
      This method executes outstanding ReportQueue methods (either commands, like Print() and SaveToFile() or Report Editor appearance methods). Once a report is opened, subsequent command methods can take an array of report parameters to be inserted into the Report Editor report text and/or database query. The Report Editor's appearance can be changed synchronously, but the Report Editor performs commands asynchronously and all subsequent commands and appearance changes are queued within the ReportQueue until the Report Editor advises that it has finished the previous command.
      The ReportQueue methods post messages on their owner window's status bar whenever they send a command to the Report Editor and replace it with a confirmation on completing each command.
    </remarks>
  </ReportQueue.DataUpdate>
  <ReportQueue.Edit>
    <summary>
      Load a report into the Report Editor for editing.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      This method allows the user to edit the report definition (.RET) file and provides the same environment as the IDE.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example opens the "sales.ret" report file and allows the user to edit the file:
      <code language="X#">
        oRQ:Open("sales.ret")
        oRQ:Edit()

  <ScrollBar>
    <summary>
      Provide the base class from which all X# scroll bars are subclassed.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Scroll bars have a marker, called a thumb, which can be dragged up and down (or left and right) within a range of values. The thumb can be dragged to different positions on the scroll bar, or it can step up or down in blocks or units.
      GUI scroll bars automatically maintain block and unit operations. When a block or unit operation takes place, a ScrollEvent is generated with both the actual thumb position and the position the thumb would assume if the scroll bar is updated. The block and unit amounts are added or subtracted from the current position according to the scroll type that occurs.
      By default, a scroll bar has a range of (0,99), a unit size of 1, a block size of 10, and an initial thumb position of 0.
    </remarks>
  </ScrollBar>
  <ScrollBar.>

    <remarks>
      A numeric value representing the thumb position of the scroll bar. For example, the value can be the number 42. The ScrollBar:Value assign also changes ScrollBar:TextValue and ScrollBar:ThumbPosition. If the value to be assigned is outside the allowable Min-Max range associated with the scroll bar, the value is modified so it is either the Min or Max value.

  <ScrollEvent>
    <summary>
      Provide information about a ScrollEvent, generated when a scroll bar is manipulated.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      ScrollEvent events go to either Window:VerticalScroll() or Window:HorizontalScroll(), depending on whether a vertical or horizontal scroll bar generated the event.
      A ScrollEvent reports the following: what scroll bar caused the event, what type of scroll movement is requested, and whether the scroll bar is a window or a free-standing scroll bar.
      It also reports the old scroll bar position and the desired position. The old position is where the thumb was located before being manipulated by the user; the desired position is where the user has newly positioned the thumb (if the thumb is manipulated directly or calculated from the block and unit sizes).
    </remarks>
    <example>
      Normally, when you receive a ScrollEvent, you would update the scroll bar's thumb position with code similar to the following:
      <code language="X#">aScrollEvt:ScrollBar:ThumbPosition := aScrollEvt:Position</code>
    </example>

  <Selection>
    <summary>
      Create a selection, which represents the start and end of a text selection in an edit control as an ordered pair.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Selections are used in edit controls (i.e., by the Edit and EditWindow classes). The start of a selection is the position in the edit control of the first character that is included in the selection. The finish is the position of the first character not in the selection. For example, to specify the text from position 5 through 9 inclusive, you would give a value of Selection{5,10}.
      To select all the characters in an edit control (such as a single-line edit control), you would specify a value of Selection{0,-1}.
      If the start and finish points are the same, the selection refers to a cursor position. For example, the cursor position in front of the fifth character would be referred to as Selection{5,5}.

  <ShellWindow>
    <summary>
      Create a shell window, which provides MDI support for your applications.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      A shell window is similar to a top application window except that it acts as an MDI client window and all children of this window act as MDI child windows.

      The style of a child window is determined by the type of its owner. By default, a child application window whose owner is a shell window automatically functions as an MDI child window. If you do not desire this behavior, you can inhibit it using the ChildAppWindow:Init().

      When a child window is activated, its menu is automatically placed on the parent window. When there are no open child windows, the parent's menu is used. MenuCommand events are sent to any currently active child window. If there is no active child window, the default event handler sends events to the parent. For an in-depth discussion on event propagation, refer to the Programmer's Guide.

      With MDI applications, there is typically one pull-down menu which contains the captions of currently open MDI child windows. The name of the currently active MDI window is checked on the menu; also, when the user selects one of the names on this menu, the system activates the corresponding MDI window.
      Use the Menu:SetAutoUpdate() method to specify which pull-down menu to use.

    <param name="oHelpRequestEvent">The HelpRequestEvent object that describes which item help is being requested for.</param>
    <remarks>
      <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/Callback/*" />
      This event handler is invoked only if the help mechanism has been enabled for the current window (or one of its owners).
      The help mechanism is enabled by assigning a HelpDisplay object to the windows HelpDisplay property.
      The default implementation of this event handler is to display the help topic that is associated with the control, menu command, or window region with focus when the HelpRequestEvent was generated. This is accomplished using HelpDisplay:Show(&lt;cKeyword&gt;), where &lt;cKeyword&gt; is either a HyperLabel:HelpContext property or a default keyword generated by this event handler in cases where a hyperlabel is not available.
      If there is no hyperlabel for an item, the keyword generated is as follows:
      A HELPCONTROL request generates the keyword Control_xxxx, where xxxx is the numeric ID of the control, in decimal. For example, an OK push button might generate the keyword Control_101.
      A HELPMENU request generates the keyword Menu_xxxx, where xxxx is the "cleaned" text of the menu command. The cleaned text has all leading and trailing spaces and the ampersand character (&amp;) removed. In addition, all sequences of spaces are replaced by a single underscore, and the string is truncated at the first tab character.
      For example, the keyword generated for the menu command:
      Save &amp;As\tF3
      is
      Menu_Save_As
      A HELPWINDOW request generates one of the keywords listed in the table below, depending on the window region that has focus.
      Keyword	Window Region
      Window_Border	Border
      Window_Caption	Title bar
      Window_MaxBox	Maximize button
      Window_MinBox	Minimize button
      Window_SysMenuBox	System menu button
      Window_Unknown	Any area of the window not explicitly identified in this table
      Window_WindowCanvas	Canvas area
      <note type="tip">If the Window_Unknown keyword is generated, the default behavior of HelpRequest() is to display the Contents topic as defined in the HelpDisplay (that is, HelpDisplay:Show("HelpIndex")).</note>
      If a HELPWINDOW request is received, while Window:HelpContext is defined, Window:HelpRequest() uses the HelpContext property, regardless of the window region that has focus.
      Refer to the "GUI Classes" chapter in the Programmer's Guide for more information on programming an online help system for your application.

    <remarks>
      ShellWindow:OnOLEStatusMessage() is called whenever an in-place active OLE object's menu is browsed by the user. The default implementation displays the status string inside the shell window's status bar.
      It should never be necessary to call this method directly. Instead, you can write your own OnOLEStatusMessage() method for derived classed if you want to change the default implementation.

  <Slider.Create>
    <summary>
      Creates the underlying window control for a X# slider object.
    </summary>
    <returns>
      The window handle of the control, if successful. A null handle (NULL_PTR) is returned if the control creation failed.
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      The Create() method creates the underlying window control for controls not loaded from a resource (i.e., designed with the Window Editor) but created at runtime. Normally, it is not necessary to call Create() directly—CA-X# will create the object internally as soon as a window handle is needed.

    <example>
      <code language="X#">
        Method CreateSlider() class MyDataWindow
        local oSLDR as Slider
        // Init creates the X# Slider Object
        oSLDR := Slider{self, 100, Point{10,10}, Dimension{100,20}}

  <SplitWindow>
    <summary>
      Create a split window.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      A split window provides a simple and easy way to create a window that can be split into several pane windows separated by split bars that can be dragged to resize the panes. Each pane can specify a client window or control, which is automatically sized to fit into the pane.
      A Dimension object is used to configure the layout of the split window panes. The width specifies the number of panes across (horizontally), and the height specifies the number of panes up and down (vertically). Panes are numbered from left to right and top to bottom. For example, a split window with a layout of Dimension{4, 3} is arranged as follows:
      1	2	3	4
      5	6	7	8
      9	10	11	12
      The maximum total number of panes is 16.
      <note type="tip">Static dependencies to the CATO3*.DLL files, which contain the DataBrowser and SplitWindow functionality, have been removed in this version of X#. Applications not using a data browser and/or split window no longer need these .DLLs. This leads to a smaller memory footprint, faster application startup, and smaller installations.</note>

  <StatusBar>
    <summary>
      Create a status bar for use in a window.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      A status bar is the shallow bar that appears usually at the bottom of a window to provide status information to the user without taking up much screen "real-estate." Visual Object's status bar class has methods to present the following kinds of information:
      Status messages (permanent or transient)
      Time
      Keyboard state (NumLock, CapsLock, ScrollLock, and Insert keys)
      Virtual memory available
      A screen coordinate reading
      The sequence in which you call the various Display… methods determines the left-to-right order in which the corresponding items appear upon the status bar. Any transient status message overrides the StatusBar:PermanentText status message, but it times out after five seconds.
      <note type="tip">You never create a status bar yourself. Instead, you ask the window to do it, by calling AppWindow:EnableStatusBar(). Once you pick up the status bar returned by that method, you can customize the status bar by invoking the various Display… methods of status bar. Note that, except for the time display, the status bar items require you to refresh them. For example, if you turn on the display of available virtual memory, you must call the StatusBar:RefreshMemoryDisplay() method whenever the application is about to embark on a "memory-hungry" task. Because you never create status bars, you also never destroy them—the window does that itself.</note>

  <Stream>
    <summary>
      A class representing streams in the ActiveXControl:StreamIn() and ActiveXControl:StreamOut() methods.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <note type="tip">Stream objects are automatically instantiated by the OLE runtime.</note>
      A Stream object is automatically instantiated by the OLE runtime system and passed as a parameter to the ActiveXControl:StreamIn() and ActiveXControl:StreamOut() methods. The Stream object wraps an OLE stream, allowing you to write to and read from the stream.
    </remarks>
  </Stream>
  <Stream.ctor>
    <summary>
      Construct a Stream object instance.
    </summary>
    <param name="pStream">Pointer to an OLE stream.</param>
  </Stream.ctor>
  <Stream.Read>
    <summary>
      Read the next USUAL value from a stream.
    </summary>
    <returns>
      The next value (type USUAL) in the stream. The USUAL can hold any X# data, including nested arrays but not objects.
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      Stream:Read() can be used in ActiveXControl:StreamIn handlers to read USUAL values from the stream. You can use subsequent calls to Stream:Read() to read in as many values as have been saved to the stream by previous calls to Stream:Write(). Stream:Read() and Stream:Write() operations should be balanced and in the same order.
      For further details, see Creating OLE Servers in the "How To" section of the online help, as well as the sample applications that are accessible from the Samples tab page of the Application Gallery.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      This is from the StreamIn() method of the Calendar ActiveX sample that is accessible from the Samples tab page of the Application Gallery:
      <code language="X#">
        method StreamIn(oStream) class CalOCX
        local u as usual
        u := oStream:Read()
        if IsDate(u)
        curDate := u
        endif
      </code>
    </example>
  </Stream.Read>
  <Stream.Write>
    <summary>
      Write a USUAL value into a stream.
    </summary>
    <param name="uValue">The USUAL value, which is written into the stream.</param>
    <returns>
      TRUE, if the write operation was successful; otherwise, FALSE.
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      Stream:Write() can be used in ActiveXControl:StreamOut handlers to write USUAL values into the stream. You can use subsequent calls to Stream:Write() to write multiple values subsequently. Stream:Read() and Stream:Write() operations should be balanced and in the same order.
      For further details, see Creating OLE Servers in the "How To" section of the online help, as well as the sample applications that are accessible from the Samples tab page of the Application Gallery.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      This is from the StreamOut() method of the Calendar ActiveX sample that is accessible from the Samples tab page of the Application Gallery:
      <code language="X#">
        method StreamOut(oStream) class CalOCX
        oStream:Write(oOCXWindow:CurrentDate)

  <SysLink>
    <summary>
      Create a SysLink control.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      The SysLink control provides hyperlink capabilities when running under XP visual themes.
      <note type="tip">
        This control is dependent on version 6 or greater of the COMCTL32.DLL and WinXP Theams.
        When XP themes are not available, such as when running on Windows 2000 or running the application on XP in "classic" mode, the SysLink control displays the full text assigned to it - any hyperlink references are included as literal text. It is suggested that the programmer should test for XP theme support, see IsThemeEnabled(), to determine what text should be assigned to the SysLink control
        For this reason it is recomended that it is called in this way -
        <code language="X#">
          IF IsThemeEnabled()
          s := "Visit &lt;A HREF="+_chr(34)+;
          "http://www.grafxsoft.com"+_chr(34)+"&gt;GrafX&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A HREF="+;
          _CHR(34)+"http://www.cavo.com"+_Chr(34)+"&gt;X#&lt;/A&gt; on the web!"
          ELSE
          s := "Visit http://www.grafxsoft.com and http://www.cavo.com"+;
          " on the web!"
          ENDIF
        </code>
        The difference between the HyperLink and the SysLink classes is in the way that the text is used.
        In a HyperLink control, ALL of the text is passed as the hyperlink where as in the SysLink control you can mix display text and hyperlink text.

  <SystemMenu>
    <summary>

    </summary>
    <remarks>
      System menus are used to provide a series of standard operations, such as moving, closing, and resizing windows. Different GUI conventions dictate what items should be added to the system menu.
      An application window can have a system menu by calling AppWindow:EnableSystemMenu(). Using the Window:MenuCommand() event handler, the system menu can be manipulated in the same way as a menu.
      To access a window's system menu, you must first enable the system menu with a call to AppWindow:EnableSystemMenu(). You can then use the system menu it returns.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example adds an About item to a system menu:
      <code language="X#">
        oSysMenu := oMyWin:EnableSystemMenu()
        oSysMenu:AppendItem(MENUSEPARATOR)

  <TextBox>
    <summary>
      Present the user with a text message box.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      A message box is a small window that displays a caption, a message, an icon (chosen from a predefined set of icons), and push buttons (selected from a variety of predefined combinations). It provides an easy alternative to the dialog window when all you require from the user is a simple response.
      Message boxes require no sizing, positioning, or event handling. In addition, message boxes can be application modal (no processing can continue in the application until the user has acknowledged the message box), or it can be modal in relation to its owner window (no processing can continue in its owner window until the user has acknowledged the message box).
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example handles a QueryClose event:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD QueryClose(oEvent) CLASS TopAppWindow
        oTB := TextBox{SELF, "Quit", "Do you really want to quit?"}
        oTB:TYPE := BOXICONQUESTIONMARK + BUTTONYESNO
        IF (oTB:Show() = BOXREPLYYES)
        RETURN TRUE // Quit application.
        ELSE
        RETURN FALSE
        // Don't quit the application.

      A balloon tip can be displayed, pointing to an edit control.

      The tip always points to the current cursor position within the control, and is dismissed by either clicking on it, by moving focus to a control other than the control the tip is assigned to, or by typing into the text box. Showing the tip automatically sets focus to the control at the last cursor position. A form can not show more than one tip at a time, and if the tip is repeatedly shown, the previous tip is destroyed first. Tips never get focus, and there is no message sent when the tip is dismissed. If the tip is not dismissed before the system timeout value for tool tips is reached, it automatically disappears leaving focus on the control.

  <ToolBar>
    <summary>
      Create a toolbar.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      A toolbar provides the user with an alternative way of selecting menu commands. Although a toolbar looks more like a collection of controls than like a menu, it is constructed and manipulated as a menu rather than as a control. It is true that the events generated by a menu, a toolbar, and a push button are not fundamentally different: each menu command, toolbar button, or push button has a symbolic name; each type of event calls a named method; each has a description that appears in the status bar ("short help") and a help context that appears when you select context help (Shift+F1). But, since the toolbar is one object, capable of generating many events, and, since it is attached to the window as a whole (instead of as several push buttons), it resembles a menu more than a regular control. Also, the standard way of defining and using a toolbar is as an adjunct of its associated menu; this is the structure generated by the Menu Editor.

      Toolbar buttons can be presented with icons, icons plus text captions, or text only. The border around the buttons offers several different looks, and the gaps between buttons can be adjusted. If a toolbar is too small to display all its buttons, perhaps because its owner window is too small, it automatically presents scrolling buttons.
      The placement of the toolbar depends, to a certain extent, on its contents. For example, text-only buttons are long and thin, and are, therefore, better stacked along a vertical edge than along the top or bottom edge. Icon-only buttons, with no gaps, look very natural along the top edge. Icon and text buttons, with a small gap, are effective along the bottom edge.
      The ToolBar class also provides CoolBar/Band support, i.e., toolbars with separator bands:

      (This example is from one of the Internet Explorer's flat-style, toolbar bands.)

      A window is assigned a toolbar the same way it is assigned a menu, through an assignment to AppWindow:ToolBar(). Each toolbar button is associated with a menu command and generates the corresponding menu event; therefore, the menu and toolbar assigned to a window must be coordinated. The most convenient way to manage the toolbar is to associate it with a menu when both are created. Then, when the menu is assigned to the window, its toolbar is automatically assigned as well. This automatic approach, which fits the class definition created by the Menu Editor, ensures that toolbar button clicks are associated with the intended menu command event.
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD Init(oWOwner) CLASS MyWindow
        ...
        SELF:Menu := MyMenu{}
        ...
        METHOD Init() CLASS MyMenu
        ...
        SELF:ToolBar := ToolBar{}
      </code>
      (This is also the approach used with the accelerator table. Thus, a "menu" is actually a combination of menu, accelerator table, and toolbar, all coordinated and all used together.)

      It is possible to place a toolbar on any window, even windows that cannot own menus (such as dialog windows and nested subwindows). In these cases, assigning a menu does not produce a visible menu, but the toolbar is still active. It is also possible to have a toolbar button associated with a menu command that is not included on any menu, as long as the menu command is registered with Menu:RegisterItem().
      A toolbar takes up room on the window's client area. Some window types automatically adapt to this spatial conflict, but others require explicit management of space.
      The most common use of a toolbar in business applications is to attach it to a shell window or a data window. Both of these window types automatically adapt to the toolbar, so no further action is required. The data window is most likely used as a child window under the shell, or as a nested subwindow; in either case, the data window adapts to the toolbar.
      Placing a toolbar on a subwindow is particularly useful: it visually associates operations with the data they apply to. Many data windows may use toolbar buttons like Insert Record, Delete Record, Skip Next, Skip Previous, Go Top, Go Bottom, Seek, Undo, Cut, Copy, and Paste.
      With general top windows, child windows, and dialog windows, the management of space is the responsibility of the developer. With a toolbar on the window, this is somewhat tricky, especially if the user is allowed to drag the toolbar around: the room available depends both on resizing of the window and placement of the toolbar. The toolbar has the ToolBar:ClientArea access, which can be called during expose events to determine the shape of the remaining area.

      The action of control events sent by a toolbar attached to a window would seem to be pretty obvious: clicking on the Print button sends a #Print message to the window. But what happens if the toolbar is not attached to a child window, but to the shell window? Or if it is attached to the child window but the method that acts on the message belongs to the shell window? And what of a toolbar attached to a data window used as a nested subform?
      Toolbars are identical to menus in their action. Regardless of which window owns the toolbar or menu, the command event is sent first to the window that has focus; if it does not deal with it, it is sent to its owner, and to its owner, until it is handled. If no window responds to the message, the shell window displays a message in its status bar.
      More precisely, the chain of responses looks like this, given the symbolic name of the toolbar or menu command:
      Does the window that has focus have a method with a proper name? If so, it is called.
      <note type="tip">This is not necessarily the window that owns the toolbar or menu.</note>
      Check if its owner has a matching method, as well as the owner's owner, and so on.
      If no window has a matching method, the message is sent to the MenuCommand() method of the window with focus. The default implementation has the following logic: if it is owned by a window (as is a child window or subform), pass the method up to its owner; if it is owned by the application (as is the top or shell window), check if there is a window class with that name, and if so instantiate it; if not, display the message. The MenuCommand() method can, of course, be replaced with different logic (for example, the traditional CASE statement often used in low-level Windows programming).
      Thus, there are two chains of escalation: first, the system looks for matching method names up the ownership chain; then it escalates through the MenuCommand() methods up the ownership chain. If nobody reacts to the method, as a last resort, the window instantiation is tried; otherwise, it fails.
      This means that a toolbar can be placed on the shell window, on a child window, or even on a nested subwindow: it is active in any case, and the message is sent to all the windows and propagated up the ownership chain. Remember that only one menu is visible at any time, and a child window with a menu replaces the menu of its shell; but toolbars are different, they can be visible on any type of window.
      The window instantiation trick means that if we design a window in the Window Editor, all we have to do to open it is to give its name to a menu or toolbar item that is owned by some visible window.

      Note that there is a potential for confusing the end user with commands that could refer to different windows. (This problem is not confined to toolbars; it applies to menus as well.) Consider an order window, with information about an order and a nested subwindow (in browse view) that contains the order's line items. If a menu contains a Delete command, what does this refer to? Does it delete an order, an order and all its line items, or only a line item?
      Technically, the issue is clear: the command is sent to the lowest level window that has focus, so if the user is located on the line item subwindow, that window gets the command first. If it does not respond to it, the order window and later the shell window gets the command.
      However, from the user's viewpoint, this behavior is not obvious. The problem lies in the caption of the menu command or toolbar button: "Delete" is not very clear. Since the user may not be aware that the line item table is a subwindow (it looks just like a table on a window) getting different effects of Delete (depending on where the cursor is) can be confusing.
      It is, therefore, recommended that menu commands and toolbar buttons be labeled explicitly and clearly, for example as "Delete Order" and "Delete Item." Even if higher-level logic disables commands depending on cursor location and data (for example, Delete Order may be dimmed as long as there are still unshipped line items), captions should still be clear.

      For examples of suitable code, use the Menu Editor to generate a simple menu with a toolbar, and then use the Window Editor to assign this menu to a window.

    </param>
    <remarks>
      A toolbar is usually assigned to a window simply by attaching it to its corresponding menu; when the menu is assigned to the window, the toolbar is assigned as well. (It is also possible to explicitly assign a toolbar separately from its menu, using the AppWindow:ToolBar property.)
      Instantiating the toolbar does not make it visible and active. The toolbar becomes alive only when attached to a window in the same way as a menu. To reduce "visual noise"(undesirable blinking and flicker), the configuration of the buttons and layout of the toolbar should be completed before it is assigned to the window and made visible.
      To define the button layout of a toolbar, you use the AppendItem() and InsertItem() methods. Note that the item IDs must be coordinated with the corresponding menu item IDs. The easiest way to manage this correspondence is to use the Menu Editor, which automatically generates the corresponding code.
      A toolbar can be placed on any type of window. Note however, that the window takes up some of the area of the window, leaving less space to work with. Shell windows and data windows automatically adapt to the toolbar, but if you place a toolbar on another kind of window you need to accommodate the change explicitly. Use the ToolBar:ClientArea property to determine how much room is left.

      The ToolBar:AddBand() method adds a new band to the toolbar. Bands are separate areas of a toolbar control, or window, which that can be resized and moved by the end user. Each band can hold a text, an image, and a control. Additionally, foreground and background colors, as well as a background bitmap, can be specified. If you want to create a band holding a sub-toolbar as a control, use ToolBar:AddSubToolBarBand().

      For custom toolbar buttons, append an item labeled IDT_CUSTOMBITMAP. (For example, for the first button, the &lt;nButtonID&gt; is IDT_CUSTOMBITMAP + 1; the second is IDT_CUSTOMBITMAP + 2, and so on.)
    </param>
    <param name="nMenuItemID">The ID of the menu item corresponding to the new toolbar button item.</param>
    <param name="oBmp">
      A bitmap object that contains one or more custom bitmaps. Each button in the bitmap must be a 16-color, 20 x 16 pixel bitmap. The first button in the bitmap must be drawn in pixel positions 1 and 20, the second in positions 21 and 40, the third in positions 41 and 60, and so on. (Effectively, this is a ribbon of buttons.)
      It is possible to have the custom buttons in individual bitmap resource files, and create a Bitmap object for each button. &lt;nPosition&gt; is set to 1 if you use this method. It is recommended to use a ribbon of buttons in one bitmap file, as this only uses one handle. The latter method will use a handle for each object created.
    </param>
    <param name="nPosition">
      The position of a custom toolbar button in the bitmap. If a ribbon of buttons is used for &lt;oBitmap&gt;, then the first button is 1, the second is 2, and so on. If an individual bitmap is used or if not specified, &lt;nPosition&gt; is 1.

    <param name="bState">The initial state of the button—enabled or disabled. If enabled, the button can be selected by the user. If disabled, the button appears dimmed (grayed) and cannot be selected; it remains unavailable until it is enabled by the application. The default is enabled (TBSTATE_ENABLED).</param>
    <param name="bStyle">
      An optional style flag for the toolbar item. By default the style is automatically derived from the other parameters. Passing a Windows API constant can, however, enforce a specific style. The default is TBSTYLE_BUTTON.

      <note type="tip">Consult your Microsoft Win32 Software Development Kit documentation for detailed information about a particular Windows API constant.</note>
      Both the event triggered, when the button is clicked, and the description that shows up in the status bar are based on the properties of the associated menu. Thus, the toolbar controls the action of the application indirectly, through its associated menu.
      Specifying a toolbar by calling this method for each standard toolbar button might seem cumbersome. The recommended way to define the toolbar is to use the Menu Editor, which automatically generates code to lay out the toolbar.
      Note that the user can modify the set of button items on the toolbar with the configuration dialog. The program does not need to concern itself with what buttons exist, since the events come in as if they were menu selections.
      In order to reduce "visual noise" (undesirable blinking and flicker), the toolbar does not immediately reflect a button added with ToolBar:AppendItem(). Instead, you must call ToolBar:Update() to make all the new buttons show up at once. The ToolBar:Show() method automatically updates the display. For toolbars that are defined once and for all and attached to a window, there is no need for explicitly calling ToolBar:Update(), it is intended only for toolbars that change their button configuration on the fly.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      The following example adds two custom bitmaps to the toolbar:
      <code language="X#">

      ClickItem() and UnclickItem() are used to indicate status ("sticky" buttons). A toolbar button is normally clicked in (which turns the middle of the button black) and out (which returns the middle of the button to white) to indicate that its corresponding menu item has been checked or unchecked. A button retains its clicked-in state whether enabled or disabled.

    <remarks>
      A bounding box (group or character box) representing the area of its parent window that remains available given the placement of the toolbar. When a toolbar is used in the standard way, on a shell window or a data window, there is usually little need to use this property; the windows automatically adapt themselves to the toolbar. However, when placing the toolbar on a regular window, such as a TopAppWindow, the developer is responsible for adapting the window to the size that remains as the user moves the toolbar around. Thus, the window might respond to an expose event by asking its toolbar how much space remains.

    <remarks>
      Both the event triggered when the button is clicked and the description that shows up in the status bar are based on the properties of the associated menu. Thus, the toolbar controls the action of the application indirectly, through its associated menu.
      Specifying a toolbar by calling this method for each button might seem cumbersome. The recommended way to define the toolbar is to use the Menu Editor, which automatically generates code to lay out the toolbar.
      Note that the user can modify the set of button items on the toolbar with the configuration dialog. The program does not need to concern itself with what buttons exist, since the events come in as if they were menu selections.
      In order to reduce "visual noise" (undesirable blinking and flicker), the toolbar does not immediately reflect a button added with InsertItem(). Instead, you must call Update() to make all the new buttons show up at once. The Show() method automatically updates the display. For toolbars that are defined once and for all and attached to a window, there is no need for explicitly calling Update(), it is intended only for toolbars that change their button configuration on the fly.

      To set the number of rows for a (sub-)toolbar, you should do the following:
      <code language="X#">oToolBar:[Rows, #MYTOOLBAR] := 4</code>
      where #MYTOOLBAR is the symbol name representing the toolbar you which to change.
      There are two ways to query the number of rows in the main toolbar:

      You can assign your own imagelist for every subtoolbar.
      Additionally you could assign a separate HotImagelist and a DisabledImagelist for every subtoolbar.
      If you assign a Bitmap instead, it is automatically converted into a compatible Imagelist. Bitmaps for a toolbar imagelist must be loaded with the parameter LR_CREATEDIBSECTION and not with the BMP_3DTRANSPARENT which is needed for Ribbons.
      The Bitmap must have the default VO background color for Toolbar ribbons Color{192, 192, 192}.

  <VerticalScrollBar>
    <summary>
      Create a vertical scroll bar.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      There are two types of vertical scroll bars in X#: regular (created with CLASS VerticalScrollBar) and window (created with the AppWindow:EnableVerticalScroll() method). Both types have an owner window and can be manipulated using Window:VerticalScroll(). However, a window vertical scroll bar differs in that it automatically appears aligned along the right side of its owner window's canvas area and also resizes itself according to the size of its owner window.
      A vertical scroll bar allows the user to update a short integer numeric value by either moving the thumb position, clicking on the button at either end of the scroll bar to change the number by the designated ScrollBar:UnitSize, or by clicking in the interior of the scroll bar to change the number by the designated ScrollBar:BlockSize. The minimum and maximum allowable numeric values are indicated by the Min and Max values for the Range object associated with the scroll bar. The ScrollBar:Value access indicates the currently selected numeric value. A scroll bar may be bound to a numeric field in a server.
      <note type="tip">By default, Window:VerticalScroll() updates the thumb position in the scroll bar; if desired, you can change this by using your own implementation of this handler.</note>

      In Windows, vertical scroll bars are equivalent to a scroll bar with the SBS_VERT style. These are normally specified in the resource entity like this:
      <code language="X#">
        RESOURCE IDD_ABOUT DIALOG 20, 20, 160, 120
        STYLE WS_POPUP | WS_DLGFRAME
        BEGIN
        CONTROL "", IDS_RED, "scrollbar", SBS_VERT, 10, 16, 24, 100

    <remarks>
      A warning message box is a window that displays a user-defined caption in the title bar, the text of the warning, and a warning icon. These boxes are typically used to alert users to a potential error or undesirable situation. For example, you might display a warning box to confirm a delete request on a particular file (like, "Are you sure you want to delete COMMAND.COM?").
      <note type="tip">A warning box is application modal; therefore, the user must acknowledge it before continuing with the application. When the warning box closes, focus is returned to its owner window.</note>

    </summary>
    <remarks>
      Windows are central to every GUI. GUI windows can be thought of in two ways:
      As presentation objects with their visual representation on the screen
      As event handlers which process user interactions
      Each type of event goes to the appropriate event handler provided by subclasses of class Window.
      Event handler methods of the Window class are the system's default event handlers. By overriding these in subclasses, you change the behavior of your derived window from the default behavior provided by the Window class.

    <remarks>
      The window initialization code generated by the Window Editor calls PreInit() and PostInit() at the beginning and the end, respectively, of the Init() method. The default implementation returns NIL. Implementation of PreInit()/PostInit(), however, results in customized initialization code which is not overridden by the Window Editor's code generation.

      The Activate() event occurs at the start of the window's lifetime or when the window is activated after it has been deactivated (for example, by clicking on it with the mouse). The newly active window receives the input focus.

      You should create and show cursors (if needed) in this event handler method.
      Any subclass with its own Activate() and Deactivate() event handlers should always call its owner's handlers. This ensures that the caption bars get highlighted or dimmed accordingly.

      The background brush currently in use by this window.
      A window's background brush is used by CanvasErase() and in handling Expose events. Assigning a new background brush has no effect until the window (or portion of the window) is redrawn. If a window was partially covered and is then fully exposed, only the covered part of the window is redrawn and only that part gets the new background.

      This related example will change the background color of an application's main window, and would typically occur in the main Initialize() method:
      <code language="X#">
        oWin:oColour := Color{164,255,164}

      Button click events (radio, check, and push buttons) are propagated to the window's owner the same way as MenuEvents. For an in-depth discussion on command event propagation, refer to the Programmer's Guide.
      You must supply the code to turn a radio button on (and all the other radio buttons off) when a user clicks on a radio button. Similarly, you must also be sure to invert the state of a check box when it is clicked.

    <seealso cref="T:VO.Event" />
    <returns>
      A numeric value representing the event handler to handle the event. This is usually the value of the EventReturnValue field.
    </returns>
    <remarks>
      Windows receive events from the user and the system all of the time. Each window receives only the events that are
      relevant to it. For each event that is generated, two things happen:
      1.	The event is converted to a particular Event object (an ExposeEvent or a MouseEvent, for example) according to the action that triggered the event.
      2.	The appropriate event handler is called, and this typed Event object is passed to it.
      <note type="tip">
        If you want to set a specific return value for the underlying window procedure, you have to change the EventReturnValue variable for the window object.
        If you want to handle other events (for example, timer events), you need to write your own Dispatch() method.
        The following guidelines should be followed when writing a customized Dispatch() method:
        1.	Subclass an event type appropriate to the type of operation for which it is being used.
        2.	Add an event handler function to your derived object. (This event handler should be called with the event when the event is received.)
        3.	In general, the implementation of this event handler should call Default(). This keeps the same behavior as the base class, but it also
        allows other classes to provide useful event handlers for your new type of event, allowing you to provide a framework for other classes to use.
        The base class Dispatch() method should be called in those cases where the received event is not handled by the customized dispatcher.
        For example:
        <code language="X#">RETURN SUPER:Dispatch(&lt;oEvent&gt;)</code>
      </note>
      You can now write a DispatchUnknown( oEvent ) method on your own window class to handle messages that are not processed by the window.
      When this message exists then it will be automatically called by the Dispatch() method inside the Window class.
      <example>
        <code language="X#">
          METHOD DispatchUnknown(oEvent) CLASS MyCustomWindow
          // Your code
          // If you need the default window
          //	procedure call SELF:Default(oEvent)
          // Assign the event return value to SELF:EventReturnValue,
          //	the default value is 0l.
          SELF:EventReturnValue := 1l

      In complex dialog windows that contain many edit controls, it makes sense to grab the edit control's text when the focus is changing so that other controls can be updated with it if necessary.
      See the ButtonClick() method for an example of similar syntax to be used in this method.

    <seealso cref="T:VO.FocusChangeEvent" />
    <remarks>
      <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/Callback/*" />
      If your window uses cursors, you should hide the window's cursor when the focus is changed to a different window, and then show the cursor when the window receives focus again. This should be used in conjunction with the Window:Activate() and Window:Deactivate() event handlers.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      This example demonstrates how Window:FocusChange() displays the cursor at the specified cursor position when focus is gained. If the focus is lost, the cursor is hidden:
      <code language="X#">
        METHOD FocusChange(oFocusChangeEvt) CLASS MyTopAppWindow

    <seealso cref="T:VO.HelpRequestEvent" />
    <remarks>
      <include file="Gui.xml" path="doc/Callback/*" />
      This event handler is invoked only if the help mechanism has been enabled for the current window (or one of its owners). The help mechanism is enabled by assigning a HelpDisplay object to the windows HelpDisplay property.
      The default implementation of this event handler is to display the help topic that is associated with the control, menu command, or window region with focus when the HelpRequestEvent was generated. This is accomplished using HelpDisplay:Show(&lt;cKeyword&gt;), where &lt;cKeyword&gt; is either a HyperLabel:HelpContext property or a default keyword generated by this event handler in cases where a hyperlabel is not available.
      If there is no hyperlabel for an item, the keyword generated is as follows:
      A HELPCONTROL request generates the keyword Control_xxxx, where xxxx is the numeric ID of the control, in decimal. For example, an OK push button might generate the keyword Control_101.
      A HELPMENU request generates the keyword Menu_xxxx, where xxxx is the "cleaned" text of the menu command. The cleaned text has all leading and trailing spaces and the ampersand character (&amp;) removed. In addition, all sequences of spaces are replaced by a single underscore, and the string is truncated at the first tab character.
      For example, the keyword generated for the menu command:
      Save &amp;As\tF3
      is
      Menu_Save_As
      A HELPWINDOW request generates one of the keywords listed in the table below, depending on the window region that has focus:
      <list type="table">
        <listheader>
          <term>Keyword</term>

      <note type="tip">If the Window_Unknown keyword is generated, the default behavior of HelpRequest() is to display the Contents topic as defined in the HelpDisplay (that is, HelpDisplay:Show("HelpIndex")).</note>
      If a HELPWINDOW request is received, while Window:HelpContext is defined, Window:HelpRequest() uses the HelpContext property, regardless of the window region that has focus.

  <Window.Hide>
    <summary>
      Hide this window so it is not visible.

      The default behavior for this event handler is to update the thumb position of the scrollbar; this can be changed using your own implementation of the handler. This event handler only works for HorizontalScrollBar and WindowHorizontalScrollBar objects. If the application has vertical scroll bars, use a WindowVerticalScrollBar event handler.

      The customized initialization code will not be overridden by the Window Editor's default initialization code.
      A call to PreInit() is automatically generated at the beginning of the Init() method.
      You can customize the code generation by changing the [PreInitCall] and [PreInit] sections

      The default implementation of PostInit() in this class is empty.
      <note type="tip">
        In .Net it is normally not allowed or recommended to run code in a class before the parent constructor is called.
        The generated code in the Window editor does this (it calls PreInit before the SUPER() call). We advise you to
        be very careful not to touch protected instance variables inherited from parent classes, since these may not be
