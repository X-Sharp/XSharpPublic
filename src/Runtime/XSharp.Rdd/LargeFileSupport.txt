Changes for X# 3.0 for larger DBF files:

- Inside DBF class: 
  Change Recno and RecCount from LONG to DWORD. The header already has room for 32 bits record locations
  This also includes Goto(), GotoId(), _lockRecord, _unlockRecord etc
- There are some references to UINT64. Check these
- Change SortRecord class to use DWORD instead of LONG for Recno


DBFCDX
- Record numbers become DWORD instead of LONG. Add a check for 0xFFFFFFFF because that has a special meaning.
- Change Recno in all structures to DWORD
- Change LeftPtr and RightPtr to DWORD and initialize them with 0xFFFFFFFF
- Harbour has a large CDX file support by storing page no instead of page location in the CDX. 
  See Harbour header files. signature is set to CDX_HARBOUR_SIGNATURE 
  #define CDX_HARBOUR_SIGNATURE               0x52434842L /* Harbour index signature: RCHB */
  indexSig indicates normal or large. Normal = 0x01, Large = 0x21.
  See hbrddcdx.h for documentation of where fields are stored in the tagheader
- Change PageNo in all structures to DWORD
- Change comparisons of PageNo with -1 to 0xFFFFFFFF

DBFNTX
- Change Recno in all structures to DWORD
- Change PageNo in all structures to DWORD
- Change comparisons of PageNo with -1 to 0xFFFFFFFF
- Change PageOffSet to DWORD
- Change comparisons of PageOffSet with -1 to 0xFFFFFFFF
